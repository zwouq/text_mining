--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are very pleased to have announced earlier today the proposed merger of Kintara and TuHURA and are looking forward to walking you through the exciting value proposition that we believe provides increased value for stakeholders of both companies. We believe this merger would provide Kintara's stockholders with a risked diversified development pipeline and transform the company into a Phase 3 clinical stage company.
TuHURA's Immune Fx or IFx personalized cancer vaccines that are designed to overcome tumor intrinsic factors which allow tumors to escape recognition and attack by the patient's immune system. It is designed to prime the activation of an innate immune response which can target and destroy cancer cells. The lead product candidate, IFx-2.0 is being developed under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway for the treatment of an aggressive form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.
TuHURA expects to initiate a Phase 3 registration study in the second half of this year. In an ongoing Phase 1b study, IFx-2.0 demonstrated the ability to produce durable systemic anti-tumor responses in 80% of patients who initially failed therapy with checkpoint inhibitors. In additions to its cancer vaccine technology,
TuHURA is also developing bifunctional antibody drug conjugates or ADCs designed to target the myeloid derived suppressor cells and modulate the tumor microenvironment to overcome factors outside the biology of the tumor to leads to acquired resistance, causing cancer immunotherapy to stop working. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells play a central role in acquired resistance by creating a highly immune suppressive microenvironment in which the tumor can live and escape immune attack.
So as you can see, a combination with TuHURA would transform the company into a Phase 3 ready company with two innovative technology platforms that have the ability to fuel a growing pipeline for years to come. With the proposed transaction that we announced today. I believe the combined company would well be positioned to make a true difference in the lives of patients suffering from cancer while also delivering near- and long-term value to our shareholders.
I'd like to summarize the key details of the transaction, under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to stockholder approval on a pro forma basis. Post-merger Kintara equity holders are expected to collectively own up to approximately 5.45%, including the shares underlying that contingent value rights or CVRs to be received by certain of the -- Kintara's equity holders and TuHURA equity holders are expected to collectively own approximately 94.55% with the CVR of the common stock of Kintara on a pro forma fully diluted basis.
As part of the 5.45% pro forma ownership pre-merger Kintara stockholders, certain warrant holders and certain preferred stockholders of record will receive a CVR. Holders of the CVR will be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock of Kintara in connection with Kintara's ongoing NIH-sponsored and funded open-label 15-patient study of REM-001 in patients with cutaneous metastatic breast cancer.
The additional shares of Kintara through the CVR will be earned and distributed if the study shows an acceptable benefit risk profile. Once completed, the company expects to seek -- to out-license or identify or acquire -- and acquire for the technology.
In connection with the transaction, TuHURA has a $31 million subscribed financing convertible notes that will convert into common equity at the closing of the merger. And that financing is included in the pro forma ownership percentages I just mentioned.
Following the merger, the combined company, TuHURA Biosciences will be headquartered in Tampa, Florida and the executive officers are expected to be Dr. Bianco as Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Dearborn, CPA as Chief Financial Officer. The merger agreement provides that the Board of Directors of the combined company will be composed of five members, with four members initially designated by TuHURA and one member initially designated by Kintara.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Jim Bianco to provide additional background and details into TuHURA's technologies, pipeline and strategy. Jim?

Thank you, Robert, I could not be more excited about the merger between our companies. As Robert mentioned, we're a Phase 3-registration stage company with novel technologies targeting two compelling areas in the immuno-oncology space, specifically personalized cancer vaccines and antibody drug conjugates or so-called ADCs. And we built a pipeline of drug candidates that span preclinical development for our bifunctional ADCs to IND-enabling studies for our intravenous tumor-targeted mRNA cancer vaccine to our Phase 3 registration trial for our pDNA vaccine in Merkel cell carcinoma, really providing the company with what we believe is a well-balanced risk diversified pipeline.
Our IFx-2.0 cancer vaccine is entering a Phase 3 trial as adjunctive therapy with Keytruda, Merck's checkpoint inhibitor, with the goal of increasing intruders response rate. Now we believe allowing checkpoint inhibitors to work better in more patients is an attractive, high-value commercial opportunity for the following reasons: checkpoint inhibitors have clearly revolutionized the treatment of cancer, even in some cases replacing chemotherapy as a new standard of care. They are currently approved in more than 20 types of cancers with nine checkpoint inhibitors on the market and several more in development.
Look, Merck's checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda clearly dominates this market with sales far exceeding the others. They're on a run rate this year in 2024 of about $30 billion of sales, which represents almost 40% of Merck's total annual sales. So importantly, Keytruda comes off patent in 2028, which may be relevant to our Phase 3 trial design, which we'll discuss shortly. So when checkpoint inhibitors work, they typically produce long-lasting remissions. Unfortunately, they only work in about 20% to 30% of patients. So increasing the response rate to checkpoint inhibitors really represents an attractive commercial opportunity.
But let me tell you a little bit how our personalized cancer vaccine, IFx-2.0 works to overcome the main reason checkpoint inhibitors fail, and we call that process primary resistance. Now in order for a checkpoint inhibitor to work, your tumor must appear foreign to your immune system resulting in the activation of so-called cancer fighting T cells. However, the majority of tumors don't look far into your immune system. So therefore, the primary goal of any cancer vaccine is to make your tumor look foreign and activate an immune response so that checkpoint inhibitors can work, where they would otherwise fail.
And that's what IFx-2.0 does it makes the patient's tumor appear foreign and activates an immune response, allowing checkpoint inhibitors to work. And the way IFx-2.0 does this is by harnessing the power of our innate immune system to activate that immune response. Now IFx-2.0 is pDNA, which when injected into a tumor cell, it codes for the production of a highly immunogenic bacterial protein, which then becomes expressed on the surface of the tumor cell.
So even if your tumor didn't look forward to your immune system, it now will look like a bacterium, which will activate an immune response against the tumor. I mean, pathogens like viruses and bacteria are made up of proteins that have a very specific molecular fingerprint or patterns that are called motifs. And these molecular patterns are recognized by pattern recognition receptors on our immune cells that are present at birth and these immune cells are called antigen presenting cells or APCs, and they're part of our innate immune system.
Well, these receptors have been conserved and preprogrammed through evolution to recognize specific patterns -- in these specific patterns as the body's first line of defense against pathogens like bacteria, which will naturally activate an innate immune response. We've activated APCs. Once they're activated, will recognize the bacterial protein as being foreign before, will digest the entire tumor cell package, all of the tumor foreign proteins, or what I term neoantigens, that are present inside the tumor and then presented to newly produced T cells and B cells.
Now your T cells and B cells are educated to these tumor foreign antigens and will, in the case of B cells, produce tumor-specific antibodies and these antibodies along with tumor-specific T cells will seek out, attack and destroy the patient's tumor. It is in this setting that checkpoint inhibitors can now work to amplify the tumor killing ability of T cells.
To test the ability of IFx-2.0 to prime an innate immune response, we conducted a Phase 1b trial amongst patients with an aggressive form and often lethal form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma and another skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. And the trial was designed to test different doses and schedules of IFx-2.0 to determine the best dose and schedule to maximize activation of an immune response.
On the right-hand panel, you can see that there were three cohorts, with three patients in each cohort and IFx was administered once weekly for one, two or three weeks. And the study demonstrated that IFx-2.0 can be safely administered weekly for three weeks. It also demonstrated that a patient's immune response was more robust at the three weekly dose level, which is the dosing schedule that we subsequently chose for future studies, including our Phase 3 registration directed trial.
So following that safety portion of the protocol, the investigator rechallenge most of the patients with the checkpoint inhibitor. And based on those results that I'll discuss shortly shortly. the study opened an expansion phase to enroll additional 11 patients. So the results in the first nine patients were reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, so-called ASCO last -- in June of last year, and the preliminary trial results for all 20 patients was submitted for presentation to ASCO for this year.
I'm going to present the data that was reported last year at the ASCO meeting on five of the six patients with advanced Merkel cell and two of three patients with advanced squamous cell. And these patients received first-line therapy with Keytruda or Keytruda-like checkpoint inhibitor and no subsequent therapy before receiving IFx-2.0 on the Phase 1b trial.
Now following IFx-2.0, each of these seven patients were then retreated or rechallenged with Keytruda or Keytruda-like drug even after having failed This slide shows the chronology of these patients' treatment. Patients one through five, noted on the left hand side, those are patients that had Merkel cell carcinoma and Patient six and seven had squamous cell. Now as I mentioned, each of these patients received first-line therapy with Keytruda or Keytruda-like checkpoint inhibitor. And that's shown by the dark purple bars, where PD stands for progressive disease.
Each patient rapidly progressed while receiving a checkpoint inhibitor as their first-line therapy. Once they progressed, they stopped receiving the checkpoint inhibitor and entered onto our IFx-2.0 Phase 1b trial. So if you look the yellow bar, that shows when IFx-2.0 was administered typically into several cancerous skin lesions or lymph nodes. And then following IFx-2.0 evaluation for safety, they then went on to receive the same class to checkpoint inhibitor that they just had failed.
And as you'll see, four of the five patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, and one of the two patients with squamous cell achieved a durable anti-tumor response ranging from partial response, which is noted as PR, a pathologic complete response or a complete response.
Again, that's being CR. So we also observed the ability to overcome checkpoint inhibitor resistance in a separate Phase 1 trial that was conducted in patients with advanced refractory melanoma, where three of the four patients achieved an anti-tumor response. Those data are being published later this year in cancer immunology in the Journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time focusing on them today.
I thought it would be helpful to show you the degree of clinical responses that were observed following IFx-2.0 and the subsequent [rechallenged] with the checkpoint inhibitor.
So let's look in the left-hand panel. This is a patient with, what is termed in-transit metastasis. All of those nodules are metastatic deposits of Merkel cell cancer. And you can see despite receiving three months of avelumab. Avelumab is a Keytruda like checkpoint inhibitor, it's actually developed by one of Merck's competitive -- competing company, it's called AstraZeneca. And despite receiving avelumab , these patients had their lesions continue to grow and spread.
Patient came off the checkpoint inhibitor. And you could see in the upper right hand corner of that panel, on the left-hand side, a little sharpie mark, and that's where IFx was administered to several of the Merkel lesions. And in this case, once weekly for three weeks. That patient was then put back on a checkpoint inhibitor. And in this case, it was Keytruda. And you could see in the middle panel, you see marked necrosis of the tumor and regression of the tumor. And then ultimately, with clearing of the lesion, if you look at the right-hand panel and that patients partial response, PR, lasted 33 months.
Okay. So here's another example. This is a CT scan of a patient's thigh. If you look at the left-hand panel, there's a blue arrow that points to a large solitary tumor mass that's essentially a metastatic massive Merkel cell carcinoma. And despite this patient receiving three months of Keytruda, that tumor continued to grow, at which point, the patient -- the Keytruda was stopped and the patient received IFx-2.0. And IFx was injected once weekly for two weeks into that tumor mass as shown by the blue arrow. And then following IFx, the patient was retreated with Keytruda and the panel on the right shows really a marked reduction in the size of that lesion, which classified it as a PR.
However, upon surgical removal of that lesion, that pathology revealed no evidence of tumor. And that response then was reclassified from radiographic PR to a so-called pathologic CR. And that patient's response is ongoing now for more than 23 months.
So this is a CT scan of a patient's abdomen. If you look at the left-hand panel, a is the anterior or front of the abdomen, b is the post area, you can see the blue arrows point to subdermal metastatic deposits of Merkel cell carcinoma. And if you look in the center of the CT scan, you'll see these blue lines and that represents measurements of two very large retroperitoneal tumors, they are tumors in the abdomen.
Like the other cases, you see this patient's cancer progressed through two months of Keytruda, at which point the drug was discontinued. IFx was then injected into those subdermal lesions where the arrows are. And following the IFx, they were then rechallenged with the Keytruda-like drug. And you can see in the right-hand panel, those two subdermal lesions disappeared and the large masses in the abdomen shrunk by 80%. And that partial response is ongoing also at 20 months.
Now let me provide a little background on Merkel cell carcinoma. I mean, this is an aggressive form of skin cancer, is called by a virus called polyomavirus, and it infects approximately 2,500 patients each year in the US. And in 2018, the checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda received accelerated approval as first-line therapy for advanced or metastatic Merkel cell. And that approval was based on a single-arm study showing that Keytruda kept produced an overall response rate of 56%, with 20% of those responses being CRs and 36% being PRs.
And the reason that's important, if you look at the panel on the right-hand side, if you achieve the CR with Keytruda, almost 75% of those patients were still in CR at two years. And almost 50% are still in PR at two years, if you achieved the PR with Keytruda therapy. And those data really have set a new standard of care for advanced Merkel cell. And while they are encouraging, there clearly still exists a major unmet medical need, right, as there's no effective or approved therapies for the other half of patients who don't respond to Keytruda.
Now so given that our data demonstrating that IFx may in fact provide durable responses in patients who failed checkpoint inhibitor therapy when they're retreated with the checkpoint inhibitor, we approach the FDA focusing on the potential to conduct a single registration trial utilizing the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, a process that has worked successfully, for me, with three other drug candidates at my prior company, okay?
So working with both the FDA's office of cellular tissue and gene therapy, and importantly, the Oncology Center of Excellence, the FDA agreed to our ability to conduct a single randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with advanced Merkel cell carcinoma who are checkpoint inhibitor naïve, meaning they haven't yet seen the checkpoint inhibitor and to be allowed to do that under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway.
In addition, we were encouraged by the FDA to conduct this trial in the first-line treatment setting. And that rationale was really driven by the results that we generated, demonstrating the potential to salvage patients who are failing first-line checkpoint inhibitor therapy. So treating with IFx prior to failure may, in fact, allow more patients to respond to frontline Keytruda than what is typically observed with Keytruda alone. So in this Phase 3 trial, patients will receive Keytruda. Again, the front-line standard of care along with placebo injections compared to Keytruda and adjunctive therapy with IFx-2.0 given once weekly for three weeks. And the primary endpoint of the study is the overall response rate, which is CRs plus PRs.
The FDA instituted an accelerated approval program to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fulfill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint like overall response, I mean, [ORR] is utilized in accelerated approval trials, since response rates can be evaluated at three months and confirmed at six months, at which point if the data's positive, a drug candidate can be submitted for regulatory approval consideration.
If you look at endpoints like progression-free survival, PFS or overall survival, those endpoints may take four to five years before they are valuable and those results -- before they become available for a potential submission for regulatory approval. We expect to begin this Phase 3 trial in the second half of this year.
We project about 12 months for patient enrollment, about 118 patients over that period of time that need to be followed approximately for six months. And that would allow us to analyze for the top-line data looking at the primary endpoint of overall response rate. We also expect to conduct this trial under what is termed as Special Protocol Assessment agreement or SPA with thge FDA.
So unlike fast-track or orphan drug designation, THE accelerated approval pathway is not really granted frequently by the FDA. In fact, last year, the FDA posted on the website that there were more than 12,000 ongoing oncology Phase 3 trials, with only 54 trials being conducted under the accelerated approval pathway. And most of those trials under accelerated approval are conducted by large biotech or pharma companies.
Yeah, we recognized Merkel cell is a relatively small indication, with about 2000 patients actively receiving frontline therapy with Keytruda. However, since the biologic mechanism of how tumors don't respond to checkpoint inhibitors is similar irrespective of the type of cancer, then IFx may have the ability to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors across a large number of cancer types, which incur at a much higher incidence like breast cancer or ovarian cancer.
So we anticipate starting what is termed, a basket trial across several cancers like ovarian and triple-negative breast cancer among patients whose tumors exhibit primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, but we expect to start that later this year. And this could lead to the potential expansion, right? And also the obvious potential commercial application for IFx-2.0.
Okay. So I've been talking about how IFx-2.0 uses intra-tumoral injection of our pDNA to prime an innate immune response. But what about for tumors that are not accessible to intra-tumoral injection like blood-related cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma. For those diseases, we're developing IFx-3.0. We believe IFx-3.0 would be the first intravenously administered tumor-targeted cancer vaccine. And we plan on investigating its first application in a disease called aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
We're developing what are termed antibody fragments or SCFBs that specifically target CD22 and CD22 is a receptor that's highly overexpressed on the surface of malignant B cell cancers like aggressive lymphoma, that we plan on linking that antibody fragment to a lipid nanoparticle that contains our mRNA, which also encodes for the same immunogenic vector protein we see with the IFx-2.0 cancer vaccine.
Now aggressive lymphomas are often a widespread disease. They infiltrate bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, even peripheral blood has a very high percentage of circulating malignant lymphoma cells. So therefore, administering IFX-3.0 via a vein into the bloodstream, we have the potential to target a much larger percentage of the tumor than we could achieve with local intra-tumoral injection like we do at IFx-2.0.
And theoretically, this should result in a much more robust widespread activation of an innate immune response. So we're currently examining different constructs to select what we term and optimize lead compound, looking to start IND-directed preclinical studies and first-in-human Phase 1 testing by late 2025.
I'm going to close out my part of the presentation discussing our novel bifunctional antibody drug conjugates or ADCs. As you might be aware, there's been a flurry of large pharma acquisition of next-generation ADC companies. And those companies for the most part are developing ADCs focused on targeting tumor cells. Our ADC technology takes a truly novel direction, really a paradigm shift by focusing on an important class of immune suppressive cells called myeloid-derived suppressor cells or MDSCs.
And they are key to why checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies like CAR T, why they stop working. MDSCs are an important group of immune cells that are normally produced during pregnancy where they leave the bone marrow and they populate the placenta. And these cells produce multiple substances that potently suppress both the innate and the adaptive immune response. And in the setting of pregnancy, they created immunologic sanctuary for the fetus.
I mean, given that 50% of the genetic makeup of the fetus is foreign to the mother's immune system, this is nature's way to prevent the fetus from being seen as foreign and attack by the mother's immune system. In the setting of cancer, these cells are hijacked and populate the tissue that surrounds where the cancer lives, the so-called tumor microenvironment, and it provides the tumor in immunologic sanctuary to grow and evade immune attack by the patient's immune system.
So MDSCs are the primary culprit for causing what is termed, acquired resistance, which is why checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies, while they worked, now stopped working. And these cells produce multiple immune suppressing soluble substances, cytokine, they're even directly capable of inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation.
And over the past five years, MDSCs have become a major target among pharmaceutical companies, which are developing potential inhibitors of some of the individual immune suppressing substances produced by MDSCs as a way to overcome acquired resistance to immunotherapy. Both [scientists] at TuHURA and Moffitt Cancer Center discovered the presence of a well-characterized delta receptor that is highly overexpressed on tumor-associated MDSCs. And what makes this receptor so important, it behaves as a master switch on MDSCs.
Inhibition of the receptor prevents MDSCs from producing multiple of their immune suppressive substances, prevents their ability to even leave the bone marrow and travel to the tumor or even prevents them from inhibiting T cell activation. So we're developing small molecule inhibitors of this delta receptor to essentially get off multiple ways that MDSCs cause immune suppression in the microenvironment. By utilizing our delta receptor technology, we've developed these first-in-class bifunctional ADCs. And unlike conventional ADCs, ours is truly bifunctional, meaning we use a small molecule drug to target the delta receptor on these MDSCs.
The drug itself has a function, namely to inhibit MDSC-induced immunosuppression in the microenvironment. We also attached to that drug a payload, which is an antibody like Keytruda, start bifunctional ADCs have the potential to remove that immunologic sanctuary that causes checkpoint inhibitors to stop working, but at the same time, they localize in immune effector drugs like Keytruda, where the tumor lives, really allowing checkpoint inhibitors the potential to keep on working, right?
I mean, localizing the checkpoint inhibitor in the microenvironment may not only increase the ability to maintain durable remissions, but it may also decrease the severe toxicities that are observed in about 10% of patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors. And it may do that by decreasing what we term, indiscriminate off-target effects from checkpoint release T cells because most checkpoint inhibitors are given systemically throughout the body.
Now we're in the process of developing libraries of potent and selective inhibitors of the delta receptor with our goal of having bifunctional ADCs for animal model testing later this year and ultimately, plans to advance to IND-enabling studies to find a lead optimized compound by late 2025 with the objective of entering human clinical studies in early 2026.
With that, I hope I was able to show you why we're excited about the future of TuHURA and why we see this merger as being an important catalyst event for both Kintara and TuHURA's stockholders.
So at this point, I'm going to hand it back over to you, Robert.

Robert Hoffman, Kintara Therapeutics Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jim. You can see why I'm excited as well. Before we close, I'd like to touch on REM-001 and how it fits into our strategy going forward.
REM-001 is currently being assessed in an open-label study evaluating safety and efficacy in 15 patients with cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. This study is funded principally by an SBIR grant from the NIH, does not materially draw on the resources from the TuHURA finance he mentioned earlier in the call.
Given this and the potential of this program, we intend to continue the study to completion and if successful, it will provide upside. Current Kintara shareholders will be divided with contingent value rights, under which they could receive additional shares of common stock as described earlier in this call. We will also look to the potential sale or partnering of this asset.
In closing, we could not be more thrilled about the proposed merger and the expected near-term transformation into a Phase 3 clinical stage company. With two innovative technology platforms targeting two of the most compelling areas in oncology, I believe this transaction is transformational event that is expected to propel this company forward and have the potential to drive significant significant value for all stockholders. I will now turn the call back over to the operator.
