Greetings. Welcome to the Catalyst Biosciences merger call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Monique Kosse, Investor Relations for Catalyst Biosciences. Monique, you may now begin.

Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Catalyst Biosciences conference call to discuss the first steps in its reverse merger plan as announced in a press release issued this morning. You may find a copy of that release and presentation on the company's website and in the SEC filings with -- and in the filings with the SEC. Joining me today from Catalyst is Dr. Nassim Usman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Seline Miller, Interim CFO. After the prepared remarks, we will open the call for a Q&A session.

Thank you, Monique. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's investor call. 
I will direct you now to the presentation that Monique gave you the links for. I apologize it may not quite be up on our own website, but it is available through the SEC links. And I will now take you to Slide 2, which reiterates the forward-looking statements that we will be making today and then take you to Slide 3, CBIO Transactions, generating further value for stockholders. 
As announced this morning in the press release, CBIO is taking the first steps in a reverse merger plan, and this involves the acquisition of F351, a Phase III drug to treat fibrosis. We will also acquire a controlling entrant in Beijing Continent, a China-based commercial pharma company from GNI Corp. in the subsequent transaction. We will also announce today the payment of a special dividend of $7.5 million and the creation of a contingent value right for current CBIO shareholders. We plan to have a stockholder meeting in 2023 to get ratification for some of these proposals. 
Taking you now to Slide 4 and a review of our 2022 corporate strategy. We announced earlier in the year that we were seeking strategic alternatives to maximize the value of our assets, and we hired Perella Weinberg in February. As you can see in the slide, we have been consistently executing on this strategy. 
We sold our complement portfolio for $60 million in May, and then we announced a plan to distribute up to $65 million in cash to our stockholders in June and paid the first special dividend of $45 million in September. Today is another step in this process. So we announced the purchase of the fibrosis asset, F351, and the definitive agreement to acquire controlling interest in Continent. 
The total equity value of the transaction today in the -- in terms of our shell is $8.5 million, which includes $1 million in cash. And there's further upside now in new indications for F351 in other fibrotic diseases, especially NASH. We will also receive a payment of $7.5 million in cash and a CVR that has a value of greater than $5 million based on Vertex payment, which we expect in May 2023, any residual cash post-transaction closing that exceeds the $1 million net cash that goes into the merger and some potential value for any of our legacy assets that we are continuing to try and partner. 
Taking you now to Slide 5. So a little bit more detail on the transaction. We will -- in the first step here, we will acquire GNI's global rights, excluding Mainland China, to the F351 program; and two, a 65% controlling interest in Continent from the GNI Group and certain other investors. 
The acquisition was split into 2 transactions. So we first acquired the assets for $35 million of value, consisting of CBIO common stock equal to 19.9% of shares outstanding; and two, a new class of nonvoting preferred stock with conversion subject to CBIO stockholder approval. Assuming CBIO stockholder approval is obtained, GNI's aggregate voting ownership will equal approximately 80.5% of the CBIO's then-outstanding voting shares. Then CBIO will acquire GNI's controlling interest in Continent for $300 million of value consisting of all CBIO common stock.After the second closing, the aggregate voting ownership of the GNI Group will be roughly 97.5% of CBIO's then-outstanding shares, and CBIO shareholders will own 2.5%. This is all described in detail in our 8-K. 
Going now to Slide 6. In terms of the contingent value right that we will be distributing -- well, let me start over there. So if we do the math on the transactions, the CBIO shareholders will hold 2.5% of a total deal value of $343 million, which is equal to $8.5 million, as I mentioned earlier. The shareholders receive the immediate distribution of $7.5 million and then a contingent value right. And this contingent value right will provide to the holderâ€™s net proceeds from any potential future sale of CBIO's legacy assets, net cash in excess of $1 million as of the closing of the Continent interest acquisition in 2023 and net cash received from Vertex up to $5 million in May of 2023. 
Going to Slide 7, timelines. So the F351 asset purchase agreement was signed and closed simultaneously today with the conversion of the preferred stock and the transaction to be approved by stockholders in 2023. The Continent business combination agreement was signed concurrently with the F351 asset purchase agreement today but will only close after CBIO stockholders approve the transaction in 2023. 
In terms of governance, upon the simultaneous signing and closing of today's F351 APA, the CBIO Board will consist of 5 directors. GNI will appoint 2 directors, Dr. Ying Luo and Thomas Eastling; and the remaining 3 seats will be held by Andrea Hunt, Augustine Lawlor, and myself, all current directors of Catalyst. I and Seline Miller will remain as President and CEO and Interim CFO of the company, respectively, through at least the closing of the Continent transaction. 
Going now to the final slide of the presentation, Slide 8, which summarizes everything I've told you today. We are focused on generating further value for our stockholders by monetizing our assets, and you can read the slide yourself, and I think we've done a fairly good job of that, including the mostly -- the distribution of $45 million in cash in September and then with today's announcement further cash distributions, equity value and a commercial profitable pharmaceutical company, a high-value new asset in Phase II and Phase III development for a huge market opportunity in fibrotic diseases. And we hope that this will return further value to Catalyst shareholders in the future.
And with that, I thank you all for attending and listening this morning, and I will turn it back to Monique.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Sam Slutsky with LifeSci Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samuel Evan Slutsky,  LifeSci Capital, LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A couple for me. I guess with the pipeline programs at Beijing Continent, will the development of those assets just be focused in China? Or will approval also be sought globally for this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nassim Usman,  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great question. Thank you for that. No, the approval process for the pipeline assets will be sought globally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samuel Evan Slutsky,  LifeSci Capital, LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then in terms of funding the development that will come entirely from Beijing Continent, which I think you mentioned is profitable at this point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nassim Usman,  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question is from the line of Timur Ivannikov with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timur Ivannikov,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So in terms of the values that you're calculating for the transaction, I think you mentioned $300 million for controlling interest in Continent. Is that based on CBIO's trading price, which is based on net cash? Or -- and what will be -- what is the expected cash amount of the newly formed entities?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nassim Usman,  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The total value of the deal was based on a multiple -- for Continent was based on a multiple of their annual revenue. As we reported in our filings, theyâ€™ve recorded approximately $75 million in sales through 3 quarters of this year, so approximately $100 million a year right now. And based on that, the value of Continent was calculated on a multiple of revenue and a multiple of earnings. And then our value is calculated solely on the basis of the listing for the company and the $1 million in cash.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timur Ivannikov,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And once the transaction is completed, what will be the cash on the balance sheet?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nassim Usman,  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cash on the balance sheet will be what Beijing Continent brings to the table, and it will be a significant amount of money. And they're cash flow positive and profitable. And you can refer to their financials. Yes, just there is a link -- there will be a link on our website when it goes up this morning to Beijing Continent's website, too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timur Ivannikov,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And can you just talk about sort of the development plan for F351 in the U.S.? I think you mentioned an IND filing, and you want to go into NASH. Is that correct?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nassim Usman,  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is correct. Yes, the [NAFLD] in a Phase III study in China for HPV-associated fibrotic disease. And then in the U.S., the plan is to file an IND and take the molecule into NASH.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no additional questions. I'll turn the call over to Dr. Usman for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nassim Usman,  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, great. Thanks, everyone, for attending. And we really are quite excited about this transaction. I think it brings a lot of value to our shareholders not only in cash and future cash but also potential upside from our ownership interest in a commercial profitable pharmaceutical company with a very robust pipeline in a large market opportunity disease. 
Thanks all.
