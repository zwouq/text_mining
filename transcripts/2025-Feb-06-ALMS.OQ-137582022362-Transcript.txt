Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and welcome to today's call to discuss Alumis's planned merger with a Acelyrin. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and the press release and slide presentation regarding the transaction are available at the investor relations section of each company's website.
The archive replay can be accessed there following the call. I would now like to hand the call over to Martin Babler; President, CEO and Chairman of Alumis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you and good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining the call. With me, today are Mina Kim; Acelyrin, CEO and John Schroer; Alumis's CFO and we're excited to share more about our announcement. Before I jump in. I'd like to note that today's discussion will contain statements that are forward-looking. Please refer to each company's website for their publicly available sec filings and identify certain factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those protected in any forward-looking statement made today.
Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. The companies do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. This presentation also includes preliminary financial data subject to the completion of Alumis's and Acelyrin's financial closing procedures for the year ended December 31, 2024 respectively.
Actual financial results that will be reflected in each of Alumis's or Acelyrin's annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Once filed may differ from the preliminary results included in this presentation.
So let me start a little bit more about this transaction. What particularly is compelling about this transaction and we'll speak more about this in a moment is that it creates a highly differentiated late stage portfolio that we are well positioned to advance through multiple upcoming milestones with significant combined financial strengths.
With that as a backdrop, I'll now spend just a few minutes providing an overview of the transaction terms. In this transaction, the [Excel in] stockholders will receive 0.4274 shares of Alumis stock for each share of Acelyrin they own. This represents a performer ownership of the combined company of approximately 55% for Alumis stockholder and 45% for Acelyrin stockholders.
As for the leadership post closing, the current Alumis leadership team will remain in place to lead the combined company and we will operate under the Alumis name. Our headquarters will remain in South San Francisco, and we look forward to welcoming two additional directors from Acelyrin's board upon closing. Last, finally, we expect to close this transaction in the second quarter of 2025 following approval by both companies' stockholders and satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions.
As I mentioned through this combination with Acelyrin, Alumis will have an expanded portfolio of late stage therapies as well as increased financial flexibility and runway. For those of you who are less familiar with the Alumis portfolio. I want to start with a broader overview of who we are and some of our upcoming catalysts in our pipeline.
We're actually a relatively young company about four years old and we completed our IPO in July of last year. Our approach to the Alumis is all about precision immunology, advancing medicines that move away from broad immunosuppression to very precise inhibition of the drivers of immune dysfunction. We leverage our data analytics and translational insights to better understand the immune system and choose targets molecules and indications with the goal of optimizing outcomes for patients.
Alumis originally started out by doing a broad assessment of many targets, that are associated with [immune] diseases. And ultimately, we selected tick two because it is a genetically and clinically validated driver of immune dysfunction.
We have two next generation clinical stage, take two inhibitors with potentially best in class clinical profile. Our lead program is escar 001 and we have an ongoing clinical program in psoriasis and in Lupus, we're currently conducting a phase three on board program consisting of two clinical trials in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and we are on track for top line data readout in the first half of 2026.
And we expect the topline data from our phase to be [lumus] trial in systemic lupus or [doma tosis] in 2026 as well.
The phase three onward, clinical trial was supported by a phase two clinical trial in which maximal tick two inhibition led to highly clinical high clinical responses in patients with moderate to psoriasis and was achieved at the highest dose. And ESK-001 was found to be generally well tolerated at those levels.
We believe that ESK-001 is potentially best in class with broad potential to expand into additional indications and treat a diverse group of [immuno] mediated diseases.
A-005 is our second TYK2 inhibitor, which is a brain penetrant molecule and the first reported allosteric TYK2 inhibitor that has demonstrated the ability to cross the blood brain bear to address inflammation within the central nervous system. A few weeks ago, we announced positive phase one data. We plan to initiate a phase two clinical trial in multiple sclerosis in the second half of the year.
And behind that, we're building a portfolio of other molecules. We expect to file an I&D for the third clinical candidate later this year. We're excited that this merchant now adds our portfolio logo Lonigutamab. A subcutaneously delivered anti-IGF-1R for the treatment of thyroid eye disease. I'll talk more about this program shortly.
I want to emphasize that the Alumis program continued to as planned. We are looking forward to important key catalysts across our programs and everything remains on track as it as it relates to Lonigutamab. The program is promising and it has shown compelling data that may support the best in class profile for the treatment of TED.
It is the first subcutaneous anti-IGF-1R to have demonstrated robust efficacy in patients comparable to the IV administered standard of care and shown a favorable safety profile. So with that Lonigutamab has unique properties from the current compared to the current standard of care that may enable similar or better efficacy with an improved safety profile.
We have done some preliminary work on the Lonigutamab program and in lieu of pursuing excel in previously planned phase three, we plan to undertake a comprehensive analysis including reviewing all available data to identify the most capital efficient plan to confirm differentiation for the program. We look forward to sharing our plan in the future and I basically we we'll continue to review this.
So that is so that's the high level review of the pipeline. And we have a very attractive portfolio that is differentiated, a late stage drug of differentiated late stage drug candidates with the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with immune mediated diseases
In today's environment, we believe that scale and diversity of the portfolio is extremely important and sufficient capital is critical together with accelerating Alumis will be well capitalized with a much stronger financial base to carry us forward beyond the immediate readout. And that I just outlined and put us on a strong position as we prepare for potential commercialization for ESK-001.
I would like now to turn it over to Mina to share her perspective from the [filler inside] and then to John Schroer and I will then close with the combined portfolio.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mina Kim, ACELYRIN Inc - Chief Legal and Administrative Officer    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks Martin. This is an important and exciting time for the immunology space and for Acelyrin. Individually, both Acelyrin and Alumis have made tremendous progress exploring innovative approaches in immunology where we have the opportunity to make a clinically meaningful difference for patients relative to standard of care.
This merger follows a thorough strategic review process by our board of directors and the management team to determine the best and most value maximizing path forward for a seller and shareholders and our patients. We're pleased with the terms both the value cheap for a seller and stockholders and the development synergies for Lonigutamab.
As a combined company Acelyrin and Alumis will leverage the benefits of our diversified pipeline, increased resources, combined development and commercial expertise and catalyst expansion to drive enhanced value for shareholders. Alumis has a strong track record of R&D success and we believe this makes them the right partner to help optimize the development of want to go to them.
Lonigutamab has best in class potential on thyroid eye disease. And we will work hard to confirm its differentiation in a capital, efficient manner. I'm deeply grateful to our stellar and colleagues whose efforts have made today's exciting milestone possible and also to the entire Alumis team. I especially wanted to thank Martin and John for their partnership through this process.
I'm excited that Alumis shares our mission of providing patients with life changing new treatment options. And with that, I'll turn it back to Martin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Mina. And that's just noted Acelyrin shares our excitement about the many opportunities ahead of our combined company as well as our ongoing commitment to capital efficiency.
I mentioned this at the very beginning of the call but being highly efficient with where we spend our dollars to the highest value potential opportunities has proven effective for Alumis and will continue to be our approach post close. Now, let me hand it over to John Schroer to review our go forward financial profile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Schroer, Alumis Inc - Chief Financial Officer    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Martin. And I would like to echo your excitement as we included in our announcement this morning, this afternoon, our respective 2024 cash position gives us a pro forma cash position of $737 million. At the end of last year.
Since our inception, Alumis has prudently managed costs to ensure that every dollar spent generates the greatest return with our highly disciplined capital approach. Martin outlined and continued operational discipline. We anticipate the transaction will provide us with cash runway into 2027. Beyond our stand alone basis of 2026 we are excited about the value creation opportunities that lie ahead for all of our stakeholders and both companies stockholders. Martin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks John. As we wrap it up, it's important to reiterate that we remain focused on executing against the key milestones that we have in front of us at a Lumis which will now be fortified with a strong balance sheet and an additional pipeline program that we will evaluate to determine the most capital efficient path going forward.
As a combined company, we have a strong portfolio that brings broad opportunities to make a significant impact for patients with enumerated mediated diseases. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you and with that, we can begin the Q&A.

================================================================================
q-and-a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cantor Fitzgerald.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Schmidt, Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my question. First, just congrats to both parties. This is the type of capital, efficient business combination that we should be seeing a lot more of in biotech and I applaud both boards and management teams for making this happen.
I guess first question John for you, the cash that you might be accumulating from a seller on at closed. Do you have an estimate of how much cash [burn] might be happening at the company between now and say, I don't know, kind of looking at maybe a mid year closure. Does that sound right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Schroer, Alumis Inc - Chief Financial Officer    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We expect the transaction to close sometime during the second quarter. We will be able to provide a bit more detail when the S four is available. The two companies will continue to operate independently up to that point of the close. But with an eye towards being capital efficient, once we get closer to that time point, we would expect to be able to share more about what the combined company cash burn is and what the closing cash balance would be.
But with that, I would reiterate that this transaction bolsters our balance sheet provides us the cash runway into 2027 and creates the ability for us to read out all of the pivotal milestones that we've laid out on our website in 2026.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Schmidt, Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I hear you loud and clear. Thank you. And, one more housekeeping item for the ownership combination that yields 55% and 45% of the respective parties. Do you have the number of shares outstanding for either party, each party in that ratio.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Schroer, Alumis Inc - Chief Financial Officer    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will have more details in the filing. But within that, we are using approximately just under 55 million shares for Alumis and the total number of shares that will be issued to shareholders of Acelyrin at just around 44.7 million.
Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Smith with Lein Partners.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Smith, Leerink Partners - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and let me add my congrats on the deal. Just on one of them that I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on some of the analysis you intend to undertake here as you think about a potential path forward. What would you need to see to advance this asset? And when do you think you'll be in a position to provide a little bit more clarity there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. So as we outlined in our press release, we were planning to reevaluate the development for the program and determine the optimal path forward. I think the most important thing is Lonigutamab has some really interesting features. The question is how can we translate those into advantages and ultimately benefits for patients? And I think we're focused on really figuring out how that differentiation can work and what data will provide us that differentiation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Smith, Leerink Partners - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. And maybe just to follow up on that, is that decision potentially gated by data that's being generated currently or is that analysis of additional data on?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we're going to evaluate what is available today. And then we will basically design our plan accordingly and roll that out. At this point. We would plan, don't plan to start a phase three. And ultimately, we want to have the flexibility to evaluate everything and then basically make sure that we can share with everybody what the plan is for Lonigutamab.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Smith, Leerink Partners - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. That makes sense. And just one last question, I was wondering if you could just provide an enrollment update on the phase three onward program. And I guess any any notable trends that you're seeing on enrollment here as you guys progress towards the data read out in 2026.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, on that one, all we could say we haven't commented on enrollment, we have seen from some of the other oral trials in psoriasis that they enroll generally a little bit faster than the injectable ones. And we would expect that that trend could be similar for us, like for others. But we haven't really commented on enrollment. Exactly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Smith, Leerink Partners - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. That makes sense. All right guys. Thanks for taking the questions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Katherine Wang with Jefferies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Katherine Wang, Jefferies - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, this is Kathy on for Akash. So I was just wondering regarding a Alumis. Why do you think your drug will show a dose response when? So you did it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But if you actually look at the phase one that I'm assuming you're talking about ESK-001?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Katherine Wang, Jefferies - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. When you actually look at the phase one data, we have a linear dose response in phase one with very little overlap. Our percent CV for that molecule is less than 20% of all on almost every parameter. And that is not the case for so TYK2. So TYK2 has a lot of overlap in their PK. And then the other piece is we do believe that the, when you look at the inhibitor level, we actually have very consistent inhibition levels as well, which might be different with the TYK2.
So if you ask me specifically why those two, that's probably the issue. And when you look ultimately, the phase one data they did have to go do for phase two and beyond. Just because of some of the tolerability issues that they had and we did not have those same tolerability issues and we're able to do all the way to maximal target [invi]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Katherine Wang, Jefferies - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if this impacts at all how you think about, the commercial build and, and roll out there. If this would allow you to pull forward any of the planning ahead of a potential launch for the TYK2. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Vegetarian]. I don't think it's going to accelerate the launch [per se]. It gives us maybe a little bit more flexibility in the build, but we have a very judicious build plan that we want to make sure that we have the right resources now that our state appropriate and we will continue to pursue that plan until we have the data from the phase three and then decide how we best move forward from there.
Great. Thank you.
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim.
Our next question will come from the line of Yasmeen Rahimi with Piper Sandler.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yasmeen Rahimi, Piper Sandler - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. Thank you for the updates and obviously we as analysts were really much rooting for and voting for lonigutamab the interface three.
So definitely a surprise for us with this announcement, but I guess team I know you guys are going through the process to evaluate lonigutamab phase, But could you maybe talk about if you end up not pursuing forward phase three if the current cash position allows you to really divert by with the portfolio with additional assets? So, would love to hear your thoughts on if you don't move forward that, what the use of the proceeds would be long term, whether it would be towards the like two programs and pipeline enrichment or potentially evaluating additional assets that could be complementary to the current portfolio.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I would say the cash, the first priority for all of us is to advance the programs that we have. And that includes what we have from the aluminide and lonigutamab. And then there certainly is opportunity within some of those molecules as you know, there's a lot of opportunity around TYK2 and a broad opportunity for TYK2's in multiple indications.
But we always are looking for additional assets on the outside. That would make sense. So I wouldn't exclude it, but that is not the focus that we have at this point. Our focus is execution the TYK2 programs and really understanding how we can advance on the lonigutamab and make sure that we have a capital, efficient way to show a competitive, differentiated profile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yasmeen Rahimi, Piper Sandler - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Congrats. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yatin Suneja, Guggenheim - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey guys. Let me add my congratulations as well. Sorry, my phone dropped out there. Two questions for me. I am not very familiar with a salary pipeline. Is there anything else that they have already in the pipeline? That maybe it's a little bit earlier in the state in the pre clinical side? So that's one.
Number two with regard to the enrollment, I mean, now that you have you know, all this cash, like what what you could do to sort of further accelerate the enrollment in the program because as you mentioned early, definitely some of the other companies are seeing faster enrollment and now being well capitalized, there should be some menus to further accelerate that process. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mina Kim, ACELYRIN Inc - Chief Legal and Administrative Officer    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, this is Mina. Maybe I'll take the first question just on [salary] pipeline. So we had previously announced that we were pivoting right to focus on [lonigutamab] and we made that decision late last year, right? And we did recently announce that we were going to be winding down all of our internal efforts around Isaac Hiab. And so the program that will be moving over to Alumis will be [lonigutamab].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, and in terms of acceleration, we certainly have a strong effort on going on making sure that we can enroll this trial fast. I would say in terms of our, where we are at this point, we will continue to look at additional ways to accelerate, but the capital piece is not the most essential one in that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Baird.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Skorney, Baird - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah, just I wanted to get thoughts on your perception of the thyroid eye disease market. Obviously,[Tepezza] had a really fantastic launch, but it sort of backed off peak sales and, it's been relatively stagnant just south of $2 billion.
Do you see this as an issue with [THEA] or do you see the (inaudible) US thyroid eye disease market or the potential for growth? And I know, there's also concerns that most of these patients really only need one cycle of injections. You know, how do you kind of think about the sizing of that thyroid eye disease market overall?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mina Kim, ACELYRIN Inc - Chief Legal and Administrative Officer    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, this is me Mina and maybe I'll take that one. And if, then, I can start and if Martin has anything to add, I mean, look, we think that there is significant unmet need in thyroid eye disease. And Tepezza was I think a real breakthrough for patients, right? And has been an amazing therapy, but as it's kind of, gone into the market, we also know that there is significant on that need.
And one of the things that we have been very excited about with lonigutamab is, it has shown sort of ID like efficacy right in line with the standard of care, but also a potential for a differentiated safety profile in a very you know, easy to use one mill sort of auto injector format. And we think that that has the potential to really expand the addressable population, right? And especially with, the possibility of chronic dosing, we think that there is significant unmet need that Lonnie addresses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, Brian, I just want to add, we do believe that actually there is a, there's market segments that are not appropriately addressed today that you could expand into, as Mina just said, and we actually just brought on board, our Chief Commercial Officer who is very familiar with [as a]. And so we will certainly spend additional time to think through very carefully on the commercial side, which segments did you want to go after and how to best do that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Mitchell Kapoor with HC Wainwright.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Kapoor, H.C. Wainwright - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. This is Dan on for Mitchell. Thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the announcement. We were wondering what kind of synergies do you expect to see from your combined development team at this point? And how much crossover is there between Ted and more classical I&I diseases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Babler, Alumis Inc - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the synergies here, at least early on will not come from the development because we continue developing all these products. So I think where there will be synergies is probably from combining two companies and not needing basically two infrastructure for public companies.
I think we should focus more on the opportunities that we're able to pursue. Because we have three products in the pipeline. And we will certainly pursue very aggressively the two that have a clear path. And then the third one will evaluate and come back to you later on how we move forward for us. This is about basically enhancing the pipeline and, and setting ourselves up on very solid financial footing to read out through all the milestones. And that's really what we're focused on.
(multiple speakers) just, maybe just to your second question at the end of the day, these are all immune mediated diseases and, we do believe that actually having a good understanding of the immune system will help and we certainly are bringing together two teams that have a very good understanding of many of those diseases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Kapoor, H.C. Wainwright - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome. And if I can ask you a follow up, I think this kind of tags on the questions Eric was asking, I think it was Eric regarding modeling, how would, how should we expect operating expenses to develop both before the transaction closes? As well as after that, I know we're looking at you know, a capital or intelligent capital utilization strategy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Schroer, Alumis Inc - Chief Financial Officer    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, we touched on that a bit earlier. We'll be able to share more of that when the S four is available. I think we mentioned that both companies would prior to closing, operate independently with an eye on controlling being efficient with their costs.
But we will have a better idea on the at closing of what we can share with you in terms of the burn after that. I think you can do some, some math on what that is considering. We've guided cash into 2027 supporting all of the Alumis programs, the two ongoing phase three psoriasis trials, the ongoing phase two B for Lupus SLE and, that those are carried through, read out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Kapoor, H.C. Wainwright - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. Thank you so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Schroer, Alumis Inc - Chief Financial Officer    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you so much. So thanks again for participating in today's call. We're excited about this merger of Acelyrin and Alumis as it will strengthen our financial position, our portfolio and sets us up very strongly for upcoming milestones and for the future. I want to thank you and have a great day.
