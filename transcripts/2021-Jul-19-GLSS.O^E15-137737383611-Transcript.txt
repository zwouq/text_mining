Welcome to the Gelesis and Capstar Transaction Conference Call. We would like to first remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements that are not historical facts, consistent with the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Hicks, Chairman and CEO of Capstar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
R. Steven Hicks,  Capstar Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. - Chairman, CEO & CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for joining us today. I'm Steve Hicks, and with me today is Clayton Christopher. We're very happy to introduce you to Gelesis' Yishai Zohar the Founder and CEO. We've gotten to know Yishai and his team over the last few months and have been very impressed with him, his team and the business that he has built. 
When we set out with our IPO in July of 2020, we told you that we were looking for a high-growth consumer and healthcare-oriented business that was disrupting a large addressable market, and now we found that with Gelesis. We're a unique partner for Gelesis because of our expertise in growing consumer brands. Clayton is one of the best brand builders there is. He has founded and operated high-growth disruptive brands like Sweet Leaf Tea, Deep Eddy Vodka and Waterloo Sparkling Water and has proven himself as a world-class investor being early to fund leading household brands like [Buy], Beyond Meat and Vital Proteins just to name a few. So we are confident we can bring added value to Gelesis. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Clayton to talk about the opportunity and tell you why we're excited.

Today, we announced our merger with Gelesis. From a transaction perspective, this deal reflects an enterprise value of approximately $1 billion and a post-money equity valuation of approximately $1.3 billion. We believe this represents a highly compelling valuation of 2.2x 2023 estimated sales and 7x 2023 estimated EBITDA, which stacks up very favorably versus our comparables. 
Importantly, existing shareholders will roll over 100% of their equity and all proceeds from the transaction and trust will stay in the company to fund the company's ongoing commercialization efforts and manufacturing capacity expansion. We are also pleased to be joined by top-tier PIPE investors. Gelesis has developed a patented FDA-cleared therapy called Plenity, which is a very unique, proven solution to address weight management. 
I'll leave the science to Yishai and his phenomenal team. But essentially, it is a capsule that you consume daily before meals, which gives you the feeling of being full. It makes it easier to eat less and still enjoy the foods you love. The addressable market for weight loss is huge, nearly 150 million people in the U.S. alone. We view Plenity as being highly disruptive to the market because of its efficacy, safety profile and accessibility, especially relative to other weight management options. And it is extremely effective with proven trials and strong consumer acceptance. 
The beta product launch last fall, quickly outpaced supply. Additionally, the technology developed by Gelesis has highly effective applications to address other health and wellness issues in the future. Our team has been around a lot of high-growth emerging brands, and we can confidently tell you that Plenity has all the right characteristics of being the next great disruptor. We think that our brand-building expertise here at Capstar, broad network of influencers that we can utilize to help raise awareness and engagement, combined with Gelesis' extremely talented team and product, is a truly powerful combination. Yishai Zohar is the Founder and CEO of Gelesis. Yishai has been passionate about science since he was a child. Gelesis is the third successful company Yishai has founded. It will be the second company he has cofounded that will be publicly traded. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Yishai Zohar, Founder and CEO of Gelesis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Clayton. I'm really proud to introduce you to Gelesis and share with you how we are transforming the weight-loss industry. More than 7 out of 10 Americans struggle with excess weight, making it a near universal issue. 
Although this is such a dramatic problem, less than 2% of this population receives medical treatment. Compare that to diabetes, another large health problem where 80% of patients are treated.  There are surprisingly few scientifically proven tools available for people on a weight loss journey. Diet and lifetime modification are always considered first. Unfortunately, for the majority of the population, those don't work in the long term.
On the other side, the approved drugs and surgery do not really address the needs of people who are overweight or having mild obesity. For them, using expensive drugs chronically with safety or tolerability issues or risky surgery are not considered good options. So the majority of the population is left without a solution. That's why we created a completely different approach to address this vast need. 
Interestingly, COVID has further highlighted the long existing issues with excess weight and brought the problem further into the spotlight with 71 million Americans having gained weight during the pandemic. The COVID pandemic also highlighted the need for more accessible forms of care, like telehealth. For the majority of the population that are just overweight or at early stages of obesity, telehealth represents a great opportunity as many patients and physicians prefer not to bring up weight management issues. 
Of course, in order to take advantage of such opportunity, a highly favorable safety and tolerability profile is needed. Our mission is clear: to empower people to improve and change their diet, lifestyle and health using a novel nature-inspired technology. For most of the people, there are frustratingly few scientifically proven tools that actually work. The root cause boils down to 2 things: portion size and food composition. 
Most of the foods we eat have a very high caloric density, and we don't eat enough vegetables and fruits. The reason vegetables and fruits are so important is that they create a solid gel in the stomach and maintain their shape, structure and fullness through nearly the entire digestive process. We asked ourselves, could we develop a product taken in capsules that would create a similar gel as a large amount of vegetables would create in the digestive system? We wanted to treat people with a nonsystemic and locally acting approach, not with drugs that act in the brain or injected hormones. 
We use science to create the same effect of volume, fullness and low caloric density in a normal natural cycling way, like meals, which include a large amount of vegetables. We had to develop a material that did not exist. Our breakthrough proprietary technology is based on the concept of biomimicry. Biomimicry is the design of materials, models and biologic structures or the R&D of nature. 
In this case, we are mimicking some of the compositional and mechanical properties of raw vegetables. Imagine filling 1/4 of the stomach, not with a foreign object, such as the gastric balloon but with a material like this, which becomes an integrated part of the meals without any additional calories and is administered simply in capsules. Our first major milestone was developing the first and only superabsorbent hydrogel made only from food. 
In fact, it's made from cellulose, which together with water is the main building block of vegetables and fruits. We were granted dozens of patents around the world, protecting our proprietary technology. Then we took this nature-inspired technology through preclinical and then clinical development to reach another important milestone, the FDA clearance of our first commercial product, Plenity. 
I want to emphasize that we have the best team in place to fully unlock the exciting opportunities before us. We also have an impressive scientific advisory board with many of the top experts in the field. 
Now I will hand it over to my colleague and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Harry Leider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry L. Leider,  Gelesis, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Yishai. Let's look at Plenity in action. Three Plenity capsules are taken orally, 20 minutes before lunch and before dinner with 16 ounces of water. In the stomach, thousands of hydrogel particles are released from the capsules. These particles absorb up to 100x their size and water forming small pieces of solid gel. The gel pieces occupy about 1/4 of the volume of the stomach and become an integrated part of the ingested food and increase the volume and firmness of the meal while also reducing its core density. 
While most of the foods liquefy in the stomach, this solid gel stays intact as it passes into the small intestine and triggers natural gut-related mechanisms that enhance satiety. When the gel gets to the large intestine, it breaks down naturally, water is released and reabsorbed by the body and the remaining components are eliminated naturally. This natural process, whereby Plenity is not absorbed by the body and all effects are created through its local action in the GI tract is the reason why the safety and tolerability profile is so favorable. 
I can tell you that what is so exciting about Plenity is that it has the combination, its highly favorable efficacy to safety and tolerability profile. This is unusual with a therapy for a complex chronic condition like obesity. Notably, although it is prescribed and conveniently taken like a drug, Plenity is regulated as a device. It is because Plenity acts locally and mechanically without being absorbed. 
We are excited about this platform as a new way to also potentially treat other GI-related and metabolic disorders like diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and functional constipation. You'll be hearing more about this pipeline in the coming months. 
Now let me share the key results of our pivotal clinical study that was the basis of Plenity's clearance by the FDA and the European regulatory body. This placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized trial, which is the gold standard format for clinical studies looked at approximately 440 adults with overweight and obesity in the U.S. and Europe. They were randomized to placebo, which was a sugar pill, or Plenity for a 6-month period. A small number of subjects did continue on Plenity for a year. The punchline on the top line results regarding Plenity's effectiveness are: 6 out of 10 patients had clinically meaningful weight loss. This is defined as losing at least 5% of their initial body weight. 
In fact, these patients averaged 10% weight loss or about 22 pounds of weight loss. Another way to view this weight loss impact of Plenity is that these subjects lost 3.5 inches off their waist in just 6 months. So the weight loss was both clinically important and cosmetically significant. Another positive result of the study was that 1 out of 4, 26% of the patients or what we call super responders, and they lost an average of 14% of their initial weight or an average of 30 pounds. 
What really sets Plenity apart from other weight management therapies is its safety to tolerability profile. Remarkably, in the study, we found the Plenity side effect profile was similar to placebo. This favorable safety profile is again due to the biomimicry principle that Yishai discussed earlier, whereby Plenity works with the body's natural digestive processes as well as the fact that Plenity is not absorbed by the body. These compelling results were presented at the Obesity Society National Meeting and were published in a highly cited article in the leading obesity medical journal and won an Editor's Choice Award. 
My colleague and Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Elaine Chiquette, will now talk about our label and target market.

Elaine Chiquette,  Gelesis, Inc. - Chief Scientific Officer    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Harry. I'd like to take a minute to talk about the importance of our FDA clearance process and how this led to an extremely favorable label. Because of Plenity's unprecedented efficacy to safety-tolerability profile, the FDA granted us the broadest label of any prescription weight management therapy. 
It includes the BMI all the way down to 25-kilogram per meter square up to 40. This equates to 150 million adults in the U.S. alone. The other therapies are only indicated for people with a BMI over 30 or a BMI of 27 if the patient already has weight-related health problems, like diabetes, hypertension or heart disease. This means that people who are in the lower range of BMI and want to lose as little as 10 to 20 pounds could be eligible for Plenity when they would not have been eligible for other approved drugs or prescription products. 
Finally, and most important, the FDA placed no limits on how long people can take Plenity. This is very important because weight maintenance is a lifelong struggle for most and will require long-term treatment. Now everything we do is designed to help support people on their efforts to lose weight. Most people are discouraged by the weight loss industry in general and feel it has failed them. Weight management is a lifelong battle for many. So we see our role as providing long-term support in the individual ongoing journey. 
So who will we focus our efforts on? We're focusing on people with the lower BMI range, the 25 to 35. Why? It's all about matching results with expectations. For example, losing 10% of your body weight or about 22 pounds, as Harry mentioned, we saw in clinical trials, is clinically meaningful and quite satisfying for the person who has a baseline weight of about 220 pounds. In contrast, starting at 300 pounds and losing 10% or 30 pounds is clinically meaningful, but may not meet their expectations. Now our estimated target market penetration in this group for the purposes of our revenue projections is less than 1%, though we believe we can likely do significantly more. This extremely broad label is a great advantage in our go-to-market strategy. 
Dr. David Pass, our Chief Operating and Commercial Officer, will now cover our unique going-to-market approach.

David Pass,  Gelesis, Inc. - COO, Head of Commercial & Secretary    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Elaine. Our technology and clinical profile has enabled us to do things commercially very differently. Our belief is that the consumer should be at the center of everything we do, which translates in the following way. First, consumer engagement and demand. 
Number one, our potential members are people who want to lose weight. Putting them in the driver seat is paramount to our consumer-driven proposition. This also significantly reduces our cost infrastructure for large-scale sales forces. With our telehealth model, we enable the consumer to decide when is the right time and place for a free 15-minute remote evaluation with the physician. Potential members can also see their own physician if they're interested in obtaining a prescription that way, of course. 
Third, convenience. If prescribed, the product is delivered to your door in 2 days regardless of using telehealth or traditional live channels. Finally, price transparency, at $98 for a 28-day supply or $1.75 a meal, knowing the cost of the product when you buy it, not having to deal with the hurdles and houses of payers, co-pays or reimbursement hoops, further lowers the barrier to access. 
We're aiming to support our members regardless of where they are in their journey through our collaborations and strategic partnerships. Ro and GoGoMeds have been the beachhead for the initial phase of our beta launch. This is just the beginning. Our vision is to build a broad ecosystem for people who want to manage their weight. Plenity is the main tool at the center of this. Our members are choosing to engage in a 2-way conversation with us, and this data helps us predict their specific needs and wants. This allows us to augment their journey with additional goods and services like registered dietitian counseling and lifestyle coaching. 
We see Plenity as complementary and additive to many other weight management programs. For example, our partnership with WW, formerly Weight Watchers and Noom provide behavioral and educational content as well as discounts for Plenity members to their platforms. Our reach continues to expand beyond the U.S. with CMS as a strong commercial partner in China. We're considering various regional strategic partnerships to build our penetration globally. The most important takeaway that we want to convey is that our beta launch metrics have been very encouraging. 
Each month, we are selling as much as we can make. That current limited supply is based on the unique nature of the product that no one else in the world can make. In addition to our strong IP position, the know-how to manufacturing is another high barrier entry. One of the most important indicators of breakthrough potential is how different we have performed in the marketplace. In one month of limited promotion and no brand building yet, we acquired more new members on Plenity than any other branded prescription in the weight loss market. 
As of today, over 45,000 members have started Plenity and the feedback on their experience is very exciting. 
I'd now like to turn over the call to our CFO, Elliot Maltz.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, David. I'll take you through our plans for scaling and manufacturing, financial projections, use of proceeds and business outlook. Manufacturing is a key part of our story as synthesizing Plenity is a unique proprietary process and scaling up supply to meet demand is necessary for a successful launch. 
We have thus far invested over $40 million developing 3 commercial lines from the full launch of Plenity. The first commercial line will be validated later this year with additional capacity coming online throughout the launch. It's clear there's pent-up demand in the marketplace for a weight loss solution like Plenity. And in preparing for commercialization, we conducted a significant amount of research among consumers and healthcare professionals to identify a target population for forecasting commercial uptake. 
Our target population is approximately 18 million individuals in the U.S., consisting of those that not only have the right age and BMI, but have also demonstrated they are actively seeking to lose weight by spending money in the category. Plenity is available to 115 million individuals in the U.S., so we will likely get some sales outside of this target population, but we want to take a conservative approach to forecasting. 
The forecast for the first 3 years represent approximately 0.5% of the total addressable market, and we do not expect to reach our peak market share until approximately 5 years from launch. We project reaching profitability within 2 years of the full launch commencing by delivering strong margins at a unit level. Plenity is currently available for $98 for a 28-day supply and the product has a low cost of goods that improves as we reach full manufacturing capacity. 
As the commercial manufacturing facility comes online later this year, we will be transitioning from a manual batch process to a streamlined semicontinuous process with significantly higher output. Additionally, we plan to implement a new packaging configuration for the full commercial launch, which will further reduce our cost of goods. Achieving our revenue projections will require creating significant brand awareness and consumer activation, and we anticipate a marketing budget of $100 million to $125 million to launch Plenity and annually meet our revenue targets. 
Yet with our cost structure, we can achieve significant growth in profits early and continuous EBITDA growth as we reach peak market share. Here's a closer look at our planned use of proceeds, and we need about $200 million of capital to execute our business plan. We plan to invest directly in the commercial launch of Plenity to make it a success right out of the gate with a marketing strategy that greatly expands patient awareness and build member support. 
In addition to acquiring new members, our objective is to create ecosystem for those trying to lose weight with Plenity as a central tool. We will also build out a temporary broad reach sales force to create a burst in educating doctors and healthcare professionals on the benefits Plenity can offer their patients. 
Additionally, we've been awarded some significant grants that defray the cost of our clinical research and development and manufacturing scale up, which allow us to focus new capital on the commercial launch of Plenity. This is a very exciting time at Gelesis with some key inflection points on the near horizon. The full launch of Plenity will begin later this year, and we are in the midst of a transformation into a commercial organization. We will continue scaling up manufacturing capacity to not only serve growing demand in the U.S. and China, where we have our partnership with CMS, but also open up other geographies to commercial partnership or self-commercialization. 
On the research and development front, we'll have an active news flow over the next few years as the results of our clinical studies read out. Success in these trials in a result in either label expansion for Plenity, broadening the population of patients we can treat or entirely new product lines that we either license to partners or self-commercialize. 
Now I'll turn things back to our Founder and CEO, Yishai Zohar, to conclude.

We are thrilled with the positive feedback we are receiving from the thousands of members we serve today as we help them achieve their weight loss goals. We plan to transform the weight loss market with our FDA-cleared product by appealing directly to consumers and making it easy and affordable for them. We have exactly the right team in place to fully unlock the exciting opportunity before us. Most importantly we look forward to making a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of people.
