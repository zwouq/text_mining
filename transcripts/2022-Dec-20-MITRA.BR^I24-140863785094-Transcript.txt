--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, and welcome to the Donesta Partnership Conference Call. Please note, this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I will now hand you over to Benoit Mathieu, Group Investor Relations Manager, to begin today's conference. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benoit Mathieu,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Group IR Manager    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you. And as you have seen in our press release this morning, we've decided to organize this webcast in order to present in more details the partnership concluded with Gedeon Richter on Donesta. My name is Benoit Mathieu, Group Investor Relations Manager. I'm joined in the room by our CEO, Leon Van Rompay; Jean-Manuel Fontaine, Chief Commercial Officer; our CFO, Christophe Marechal; and our CSO, Graham Dixon. This webcast is recorded and will be accessible later on today on Mithra's website.
I would like to remind you that this webcast is covered by the disclaimer on Slide 2 of the presentation. After the presentation, we will open the lines for a Q&A session. Thank you very much, and I would like now to hand over to Leon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing in and for being with us this morning. We are pleased to be able today to announce regarding our partnership on Donesta. In the past months, we have indicated our intentions to the financial community to sign a binding Head of Terms for Donesta by end of the year, and we are very, very happy to deliver on our promises.
After several months of negotiation with many, many potential partners, regional and global players, we are pleased to announce the signing of a binding Head of Terms with our long-standing partner, Gedeon Richter. We strongly believe that Gedeon Richter is the right and the best partner for Donesta in the regions covered by the sales and this -- by this deal and this for many, many reasons. Mithra has established a long-term relationship with Gedeon Richter, which is a strong partner for the commercialization of our first estetrol product, Estelle or Drovelis and that since 2018. Richter is delivering strong sales performances since the gradual commercial launch started last year in July.
Successful commercial launch of Estelle, Drovelis with net sales revenues of EUR 9.9 million in 2022. Richter will be responsible for estetrol franchise in women's health, covering the life span of every woman from the contraception to the menopause.
Their sales representatives teams have the best knowledge of our innovative molecule, estetrol, and they have access to 70% of gynecologists in the territory of which they operate. Gedeon Richter demonstrated that their marketing strategy around Estelle is the right one in order to support the sales up to the maximum.
As Richter is already fully aware of the benefits of the potential of E4, we see this partnership as an opportunity for Mithra and for Gedeon Richter to gain more market share in the female health care market. Today, Gedeon Richter is a second large player in the women's health care market in Europe and has a clear ambition to become the leader in Europe, LatAm and new areas like Australia and New Zealand. 
Gedeon Richter has strong financial means to invest in Donesta and wants to make the commercial launch to a success. The structure of the partnership that we will explain to you is oriented towards the contribution of a long-term added value both for Mithra and for Gedeon Richter.
The partnership includes different geographic areas, covering Europe, Russia, Central Asia, Latin America and Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. This partnership is exclusive for most countries including Europe, Russia, the CIS countries and semi-exclusive for Australia and New Zealand and for Brazil. Brazil represents about 40% of the value of Latin American market.
Later in the presentation, we will provide you with an overview of the exact coverage countries. We expect to sign the final license and supply agreement in the first quarter next year. As for Estelle, the duration of this contract will be 20 years. Regarding the financial details, Mithra will receive an upfront payment of EUR 55 million being EUR 5 million now at a signature of the Head of Terms and the remaining EUR 50 million upon final signature of the contract. 
On top of this amount, we will receive regulatory milestones depending on specific achievements for an amount of EUR 15 million. Besides, we have negotiated double-digit royalties linked on net sales depending on sales evolution and performances. 
Finally, the Head of Terms includes the manufacturing and supply of Donesta by Gedeon Richter in the covered territories. Please note that we still are in negotiation for countries not covered by the current agreement. The United States represents 60% of the world's menopause market. Discussions are ongoing, and we expect to announce or part in the course of the first half next year. 
Thank you very much. And I'd like to now hand over to Jean-Manuel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. So Richter, as you know, is present in approximately 90 countries worldwide. So they have a worldwide footprint. They are the second largest player in the European market in women health. They have a clear ambition to become a prominent player in the league of European midsized pharmaceutical companies. They have already an established range of products in the women health, innovative brands covering contraception, menopause, endometriosis, rigidity and uterine fibroid. Thanks to this portfolio in addition to the rest of their pharmaceuticals. They have approximately 40% of their EUR 900 million sales that are stemming from women health business. 
So women health is clearly, in terms of revenues, a revenue driver for the company. And the innovative portfolio they have at this stage is clearly showing that the focus of the company is geared towards women health. 73% of their sales are realized in Europe, CIS, and Latin America, reflecting that Gedeon is clearly a company very well established in that area and is also currently expanding its footprint in Latin America.
With the market cap of EUR 4.4 billion and consolidated sales of close to EUR 2 billion, in 2021, Gedeon Richter is a solid partner to fuel the Donesta commercial success in the territory. Important to note that the commercial sales of Drovelis in Europe are delivering according to plan for Gedeon Richter and with the solid outlook in 2023.
So now for the financial terms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. The value is an upfront payment, as we told you, of EUR 55 million, out of which EUR 5 million paid by the signature of the Head of Terms. Additional milestone payments, EUR 50 million subject to regulatory achievements. For royalties, we (inaudible) on net sales ranging from low double digits depending on the sales evolution through the time and can rise.
The cash collection is EUR 5 million Head of Terms of signature and EUR 50 million at the closing of the deal. As you know, Gedeon Richter will cover a very large territory, very wide and broad. Most is exclusive, except  Australia, New Zealand and Brazil which we see exclusive. The remaining territories, we are negotiating today with several partners, potential partners, big ones in the United States.
Be aware that United States that represent currently 60% of the menopause market and could grow rapidly. Other regions will be covered by the regional and local partners that we will find.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the global menopause market is clearly an area that represents a significant unmet need for women. Women are really seeking to take control of their menopause. Women are spending more than 50% of their lives in the menopause and we estimate that by 2030, the world population of menopausal and postmenopausal women will increase to 1.2 billion.
Today, women are being offered with a variety of choices for which women still have concerns. They are looking for -- actively for alternatives with an improved benefit risk profile. The market opportunity, if we were to quantify, is to exceed EUR 10 billion by 2027 and to reflect the importance of the menopause on women's life. We need to know that approximately 50% of all women aged between 40 to 64 years of age will experience hot flashes on top of other symptoms of the menopause. And more than half of them will be experiencing a relatively severe form of the vasomotor symptoms. 
If you look at the territory covered by this agreement, Europe and Latin America, this represents more than 220 million women age between 40 and 64 years. Menopause symptoms, important to say, are severely impacting the menopausal women with 8 women out of 10, highlighting that menopause negatively affects the work and almost 1 women out of 2 is considering to retire or to take a break from work. So there is a sense of urgency for society on top of women. I will hand over now to Graham for the next steps in timeline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graham K. Dixon,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Scientific Officer    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jean-Manuel, and good morning, everybody. I'd just like to take you through the next steps and time line towards the approval of our product, Donesta. First, the U.S. study, the C302, is on track to deliver data. We expect to receive the top line raw data this week. We need to perform the quality checks and the analyses outlined in our statistical analysis plan. So we'll have data conclusions arising during the course of quarter 1. That will leave us on track to submit the U.S. filing, the NDA filing at the end of first half 2023, and we've already started our interactions with the FDA in order to prefer for that filing. 
Regarding the European study, again, we're on track with the extension of the 301 study. We will close screening before the end of the year. That will allow us to receive the top line data, safety data from that study by the end of 2023 with the MAA filing in early 2024. Because the agencies are already familiar with E4 from the registration of our Nextstellis, Drovelis product, we expect that the review time lines can be shortened considerably because they've already asked questions, for example, on the CMC and the nonclinical sections, so those should go very smoothly. So with that, we anticipate having the approval in the EU around the end of 2024 as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benoit Mathieu,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Group IR Manager    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the end of the presentation, and we can now move to the Q&A session.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from Thomas Vranken of KBC Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Vranken,  KBC Securities NV, Research Division - Equity Analyst of Pharma & Biotech    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, congratulations on the partnership that was closed here. A couple of questions from my side. First question, maybe to make sure to understand this agreement correctly. Can you provide some more insight into the rationale of some of these regions being semi-exclusive, I believe, I saw Brazil, also maybe some other geographies. What is the general idea there? And can we expect additional partners for those countries? Will that be 1 party or also different parties, just like the countries that have not been included in the deal? Could you just provide some more clarity on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So thank you for the questions, Leon speaking. The question is very interesting because semi-exclusive in the United States would not be feasible or possible. In some countries, it's doable. And if you have a semi-exclusivity, you have 2 brands with different partners in the same region. In general, we have what they can call a synergistic effect. 
If one only is selling one and the other one is selling more or less the same and both are selling more than 2, that's synergistic. And you see the huge competition on the market between the 2 brands and by the competition, they make so much noise, even the reps within the medical doctor so much noise because they want to be the best in the region that you see, in general, a higher, let's say, sales -- total sales in the region. And that's what we're aiming for. I don't know whether this is enough for your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Vranken,  KBC Securities NV, Research Division - Equity Analyst of Pharma & Biotech    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's clear. What I also wanted to zoom in on a bit better perhaps is on the countries that are included in Central Asia. I'm not sure if that -- if I've seen that correctly, but could you mention whether China and Japan are these included in the deal? Or will you pursue different partners for those kind of countries?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We are looking for different partners for those countries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Japan, we can say, Leon, that Japan and Asia is already covered by Fuji Pharmaceuticals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Vranken,  KBC Securities NV, Research Division - Equity Analyst of Pharma & Biotech    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Okay. And then perhaps as a final question on the specific deal or related to also to the U.S. or not excluded in this agreement. But could you give us some granularity on how you see time lines there. I understood, our plan is to get the deal there in the course of first half of 2023. 
My question then is how comfortable are you with the fact that -- with the plan of filing by the end of H1, given the fact that I would assume that the partner will be included or will be imported in the filing process as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the filing, I think that the part we don't need a part as such, but we will have a quarter for sure before the end of the first half next year. That's clear. The aim is, to be honest with you, we discussed with a lot of big players. At the end of the day, as Gedeon Richter is the second largest female health care company in Europe and in several other countries and have the means that they will absolutely be the best-in-class in Europe in female healthcare, so why not go ahead with them in Europe, while this is not jeopardizing any these with the American companies as in general, they see this separately. So we are discussing with several partners there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question now comes from Laura Roba of Degroof Petercam.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laura Roba,  Banque Degroof Petercam S.A., Research Division - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the partnership. First question from my side. Could you provide a bit more color on your expectations for the U.S. deal in terms of milestones and royalties?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the U.S. deal, we just -- we are negotiated with several partners, but  in any case, we cannot, let's say, tell you any secret over there because this will jeopardize the negotiations, it's clear. Yes, but I can tell you -- what we can tell you is the deal will be -- United States is at least 60% of the global world markets and the profitability there is much higher than in any other country. So we expect there to have a big deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we can say that the economics should reflect that market situations, clear?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laura Roba,  Banque Degroof Petercam S.A., Research Division - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Clear. And then a question on this partnership with Gedeon. Who will finance the submission for European approval?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graham K. Dixon,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Scientific Officer    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, up to -- approval will be financed by us. And anything required for the regulatory approval is on Mithra's side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question now comes from Cl√©ment Bassat of Portzamparc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cl√©ment Bassat,  Portzamparc BNP Paribas Group, Research Division - Financial Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And again, congratulations for the deal. Basically, I have 2 questions as most of them was already answered. The first one concern your CDMO. I understood that Gedeon will manufacture the product, Donesta, just to confirm this point with you? 
And the second question concerns the potential earn-out you will have to pay by the end of 2023. Just to know if it will be about the lower bond or the upper bond of EUR 25 million?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I could not understand the question. Could you repeat the question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It Is related to the manufacturing of the product. And so what's the impact on the CDMO?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's no impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, indeed. But we mentioned already several times that we were not producing ourselves the tablets, the blister at the CDMO -- (inaudible) CDMO for which we have developed a strategy in injectables and polymer and biologics. So it's very clear. So the CDMO is not usually more for the purpose of producing the pills, the Estelle packaging. 
And so we are using (inaudible) for Nextstellis and Drovelis is produced today by Gedeon Richter already. So it's also very interesting for us because it helps us not to finance the supply chain of Estelle, so which is a cost for us because as biotech company financing the production before being able to get the revenues from supply and the (inaudible) is the financing costs. And so for the Donesta transaction, we duplicate what we had with Gedeon Richter on Drovelis and so they will be producing as well the Donesta blistering and packaging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously, the economics of the deal are stemming from other  items like royalties, milestones, et cetera.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cl√©ment Bassat,  Portzamparc BNP Paribas Group, Research Division - Financial Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And 1 more question. It was about the earn-out. You have to pay to Uteron which is linked to your cash balance.  Is it would be closer to the lower bond or to the upper bond since you will receive a large upfront, thanks to the Donesta deal?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christophe Marechal,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, first, the cash level is indeed impacting the numbers of -- the amounts that we pay on a yearly basis. But I remind that we look at the cash of Mithra at the year-end and at the half year, let's say, closing. 
And you have understood that EUR 50 million will be collected somewhere in Q1 and so we'll not be impacting the year-end cash position. And then thereafter, so that means that there is no immediate impact at the collection of the cash that will, let's say, been transformed into an immediate payment of earn-outs. So we do believe that we will pay something like in between EUR 5 million to EUR 10 million which is related to the minimum payments of earn-outs that we have to do on a yearly basis.
And this will be done certainly in 2023. But above that amount, there is no certainty. But it's clear that if the amount of the U.S. transaction is big and if on the 30 June, we come to an amount of cash which is extremely important, we might be paying a little bit more than the EUR 10 million that we have mentioned to you.
It's also a question of how we will negotiate the collection of these upfront payments and down payments from the partners because, of course, if you receive something on the 25 June, on the 5 July, we change the whole story regarding the amount of payment to be done on the earn-outs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And up next, we have Sushila Hernandez of [VLK].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Analyst,   -     [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on your deal with Gedeon Richter. From my side, just 1 more question. Could you elaborate on the commercial strategy that Gedeon Richter has for Donesta? Can they leverage their current sales rep?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So this is Jean-Manuel speaking. Thank you for this question. So we have been working with Richter for the last couple of years and developing the Estelle launch, the Drovelis launch in Europe. And clearly, today, the partner who has the best network, the dedication, the willingness to pursue in women health and leverage the assets to transform their company is Gedeon Richter. So they have the means, they have the network, they have the willingness to pursue clearly. So for us, it's the best partner to foresee longer-term value because we're going for a 20-year partnership.
We definitely do not want to see the asset maybe quickly captured by a more, I would say, well-known pharmaceutical name maybe, but quickly [shelve] and then the long-term value would be -- will not be in there for Mithra. So to your question, what is our strategy?
Well, first of all, they have the capabilities in place. And the strategy is a strategy we're going to be working on together, like we've been working hand in hand with Richter and remain on the strategy for Drovelis and Nextstellis. We will be doing the same with them for -- in Europe and Latin America. 
We know that the menopause market has been facing a significant challenge over the last 20 years. But we have also seen over the last 2 years that there's been significant signals showing the tide was turning, and that there is an opportunity in this market. Some companies are really willing to seize. Some of the competitors out there coming with alternatives are foreseeing multibillion opportunity. Markets are also growing in some territories in Europe very significantly. So the strategy will be worked on together hand-in-hand to seize and maximize the commercial opportunity. It was a little bit longer than expected, but I hope I answered your question. If it is not the case, shoot again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Analyst,   -     [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And up next, we have a follow-up question from Thomas Vranken of KBC Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Vranken,  KBC Securities NV, Research Division - Equity Analyst of Pharma & Biotech    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I may, I'd just like to get a bit more granularity on what your expectations are with regards to your cash flow in 2023 and 2024? I understand Uteron earn-out will be somewhat limited, but also beyond that in terms of operations, what are your expectations there on that regard?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leon Van Rompay,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CEO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we expect that the R&D will wait, so R&D meaning the API investment we have to do on the E4s and (inaudible) but also the (inaudible) on Estelle and the -- of course, the completion of the safety clinical trials of Donesta in the U.S. and Europe, plus the skin health studies that will be launched and also studies. 
All that will [weigh] for about EUR 70 million and EUR 70 million is including the R&D payroll. So it's all included, so payroll of Mithra on R&D plus the (inaudible), let's say, expenses will be in the range of EUR 70 million in 2023.
And so of course, we have a quite good amount of cash as of today on which we cannot communicate, but we have a quite good amount of cash as of today, plus, of course, the amount to be collected at the finalization of the contract plus filing of the dossier to the agencies. And also, we still have to communicate on the completion of the U.S. licensing agreement, which, hopefully, will also bring a very nice, let's say, cash down payments. 
So it's clear that the cash burn will be -- should be highly compensated by the licensing deals that we are doing. And if needed, I remind that we still have, let's say, sizable, let's say, access to facilities such as [LDA hybrid white box] and also we remind that we expect end of January to receive about EUR 7 million of euro equivalent in the form of dividend and cash capital return from Mayne Pharma shares investment. So all that will contribute to compensate the cash burn of Mithra during 2023. 
And it's clear that the amount of R&D expenses is reduced quite a lot in 2024. My colleagues are asking me to mention already also that at the launch of Myring, Mayne Pharma will pay EUR 1.6 million to Mithra which will help also from the cash position point of view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Vranken,  KBC Securities NV, Research Division - Equity Analyst of Pharma & Biotech    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's very clear. And taking all of that into account, what is your current thinking on the existing convertible bonds that has a maturity in 2025, as I believe. How do you look at that at this point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christophe Marechal,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a good question. It's clear that 25th is a year where the Estelle ramp-up sales, should I follow this holistic sector we see today, and so should really help from a revenue point of view, assuming the cash related to repayment of that convertible loan so Donesta will be contributing to support the revenues of Mithra and then help us assuming a repayment that convertible loan for the loan -- [hybrid and white box] loan that we did over the summer last year -- this year, this loan has a conversion feature that certainly makes that these loans will be converted over 2023. 
They should not be waiting in terms of cash outflow in 2025. So that is not a concern from that point of view and revenues also that will come from the market utilization, which I expect in 2024 will also contribute from a P&L point of view, but also from a cash flow point of view to help supporting the repayment of that convertible loan.
But -- and if at the time, there is a market available and if bondholders would be willing to foresee an extension of that loan, we'll see. But this is not an option for now. This is something we -- we have the time to discuss until the end of 2025 on the corporate finance strategy, but we have certainly opportunities to think about how to refinance that loan if needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) As there appears to be no further questions at this time, I'd like to hand the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Manuel Fontaine,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Chief Commercial & External Affairs Officer    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, this is Jean-Manuel speaking. I wanted to come back to the very first question of the analysts regarding some exclusive agreement for Brazil and New Zealand and Australia. I'd like to remind the audience that we have already existing partners in those territories with whom we are happy to continue to work and maintain that dialogue for new opportunities. 
And I think it's also important to say that considering the challenge in the marketplace, keeping an opportunity for additional marketing and commercial support to ensure the tide will be turning in the right direction for Donesta is to consider, and that was also in the rationale for going in this direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benoit Mathieu,  Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA - Group IR Manager    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jean-Manuel, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and please do not hesitate to contact us if you would have any additional questions. Have a nice day. Bye.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect.

of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current 
expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ 
materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a 
number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically 
identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies 
may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or 
incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS,
OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS.
IN NO WAY DOES REFINITIV OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER
DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN
ANY EVENT TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S
CONFERENCE CALL ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE
MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.
