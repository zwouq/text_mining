Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good evening, everybody, and this is a very special day, a very special announcement is there. But before I go for his return formal kind of a document, let me then give you certain thoughts, which are always made in our head in Mankind.
One thing is very clear in Mankind that we have a very, very clear strategy and we are very clear what we are supposed to do. It's like when you make a castle and people live in that 22,000 people live in that, then you want to do you make them in big tranches and big wall so that people can live safely and prosperity is always there. And that has always been our strategy to make sure that Mankind grow at a faster pace.
And what are those things which we have always talked in the past as well. One has always been high entry barrier products. We've always talked about that. Super specialty was always our longing desire. Next was the lifestyle chronic diseases.
We've always talked about that. OTX, OTC flavor, angle in everything what Mankind is doing. And we have always worked to make sure that Mankind brand equity as a whole should become an example. If you look at the journey of Mankind earlier, it was a approach, which was a bottom-up approach. Our [mark] level coverage of doctors, 4, 5 lakh doctors.
That was our style of mitigating the risk from the competitors with whatever resources we had in our hands in those days. And next was -- the second was actually OTC and brand building of Mankind, whether it was man force, if revenues, we all volunteer and get so fast, whatever. Because we wanted to build Mankind brand as a wholesale brand, big brand.
The second -- third was what, in the same -- in this strategy, we launched our specialty division during COVID times in Mumbai. And [Kim] in cardio, diabeto, and neuro, respiratory, all sort of specialized divisions and to give fuel to these division, (inaudible) products were acquired. One name, I can tell you is Combeal. Something licensed products, were taken (inaudible) was one.
And now in the same interest in is one, the next basically is what silicosis other ones because every specialized division needs some kind of I mean specialized products. And when we acquired Panacea that was also part of that plan only. I mean it was not only Clarivate. We basically wanted to acquire along with Clarivate patent product, sitcom, and most important, super specialty business of Panacea transplant business. That was clean strategy for that.
The next basically is what now we have come to Bharat Serums. So I will call Bharat Serums not specialty. It is basically super specialty business with huge entry barrier very, very super specialty kind of a business, and they have got in fertility business as well where penetration is only 1% and demand is huge, and you can really command good price over there. Along with this, we have some OTX, OTC flavored products, Lactare is one also Pan is another.
I mean, these are quite popular brands who are not properly nurtured in the past, but now taking better shape. It basically complement Bharat Serums or assume as you if I say, complement, maintain in every aspect, whether it's a high-end entry product, super specialty products in fertility [guard] products. Along with this, we are back with R&D and high and super specialty high entry barrier products.
We look at Bharat Serums many years back as well. But this capital management has really turned around that Bharat Serums 5 years back and this Bharat Serums in just three years' time, why I'm saying three years, these two years were lost in COVID time.
So if I say that whatever we are seeing to this Bharat Serums, is a very, very, I mean relevant in terms of it. It really adds so much of value. So one thing should be very, very clear that this acquisition is not to really add some kind of a revenue, but to add a lot of value, future growth, entry barrier, super specialty business in Mankind. That was basically, I mean, a very informal kind of thoughts crossed in my mind, so I will just talk about this.
So let me now come to this formal announcement. Good afternoon, and we are very pleased to announce the signing of definite agreement for strategic acquisition of 100% stake in Bharat Serums and Vaccines Limited from Advent International.
BSV acquisition represents a pivotal milestone in Mankind journey, which expands our high entry barrier portfolio and people -- Mankind. People, Mankind to leadership in women health. Now Mankind becomes in Women Health care number 1 Gynae portfolio in IPM. The deal is valued at an enterprise value of INR13,630 crore -- INR13,630 crores subjected to closing related adjustments.
BSV complex portfolio across human health, fertility and critical care segment, perfectly aligned Mankind Pharma strategic vision to expand its footprint in high-entry barrier portfolio, BSV is ranked number 1 or number 2 in 9 out of top 10 fast-growing brands with limited competition in India and closed FY24, we have consolidated reported revenue of INR1,723 crores, delivering a robust 20% year-on-year growth.
BSV acquisition is in line with our stated acquisition thesis of, again, high-entry barriers, business with a long runway for growth, especially the R&D that platform solidifying our position offering in special drugs, commentary portfolio with high potential OTX brands, EBITDA margin accretive to Mankind's margin unlock synergy by leveraging Mankind's extensive reach to target a rapidly growing, highly underpenetrated market, especially in fertility as well, I would say.
We believe women's health and fertility segment holds immense potential, along with strong growth visibility globally, fueled by structural tailwinds like lifestyle change, delayed parenthood, rising chronic conditions. BSV is strategically positioned to leverage these trends with our extensive range of products that cover the entire human health spectrum from fertility to pregnancy and post pregnancy.
In the fertility side, BSV offers a comprehensive portfolio designed to scale across both the Indian and international markets, particularly as the IVF treatments become more prevalent.
The market leadership of the company is further evidenced by its advanced and differentiated product offering. Beyond product offering, BSV has a developed robust specialty R&D tech platform with capabilities in recombinant, niche biologics, novel delivery and immunological -- immunoglobins.
One of the prime example of BSV is R&D capabilities is anti-D where, BSV is the only [rate] in the world to develop patency recombinant, anti RHO. This product prevents RH isoimmunization in pregnant mothers. RH negative mothers with RH positive feeders, where it is required, actually.
RH platform significantly adds to Mankind's to R&D with them, along with potential opportunity from high-value specialty pipeline in both women's health and critical care. BSV portfolio, spanning women's health, fertility, critical care and BSV speciality, R&D's tech platform, along with Mankind extensive scale and the reach is set to deliver remarkable growth.
In recent years, our strategic initiatives during the launch of specialty chronic divisions, the acquisition of Panacea Biotech transplant oncology portfolio and key license agreements with global leaders, including Novartis, a leading [cardiac] product from and from AstraZeneca for the premium inhalers Symbicort and many much more such deals have significantly bolstered our presence in high-end barriers segments and chronic therapies.
With BSV acquisition, we will enhance Mankind's capabilities in the specialty and niche portfolio built on robust R&D tech platform. Along the leadership in Indian women health market. As we welcome, BSV is 2,500 members to our Mankind family.
We are filled with a filter excitement and purpose together we will collaborate to harness (inaudible). That is very, very important because really, I mean have a fantastic synergy here, benefits the synergy as well. And that will sustain growth in market leadership, driven by our shared value and dedication towards making a positive impact on the health care.
Now I'll pass on to Sheetal.

Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Rajeev. Good evening, everyone, and welcome, everyone. First of all, thank you, everyone, for joining this investor call. If -- since last one year, we are doing this investor call -- and whenever any question came about acquisition. In all previous calls, we have said that whenever any opportunity come for recognition, we will go for a company which has a very high-entry barrier product, super specialty product, had a flavor of OTP and EBITDA accretive.
And in the last few months, we have seen a number of assets, but BSV stand out that it is matching our criteria for 100% for acquisition. Why because BSV has developed some niche biological products and recombinant in-house, which has a long-term assurance of less or very minimum competition.
They have a very strong R&D capability and robust portfolio for fertility, women health and critical care. If I talk about opportunity of infertility product -- that is a very, very big opportunity in the world.
According to WHO report, infertility effect, one in six people across the globe and IVF adoptation is still in its early stages in India and in other emerging markets. Fertility drug market is big and fast-growing segment in India and globally. BSV is well poised to capture this market with most comprehensive fertility portfolio. BSV has a specialty branded portfolio in international markets with focus presence across seven brand families with increasing focus on fertility segment.
BSV branded speciality pharma portfolio across India and international markets, but then immense growth potential and will add to existing growth velocity of Mankind. Moreover, BSV business will be highly synergistic with our comprehensive product portfolio, expensive field force and doctor coverage.
We are confident that this would correspond to an expansion of EBITDA margin and thereby solidify our position as a company known for marketing innovative and specialized offering.
Thank you for all your continued support and confidence in Mankind Pharma. The future looks bright, and we continue to make strides towards building a healthier work. Thank you so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abhishek Agarwal, Manchan Pharma - Investor Relation    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Sheetal ji. Good evening, everybody. Let me take you through the investor presentation. I hope everybody has seen and gone through. I will just touch upon the key highlights. So the Slide 3, if you see the transaction overview, Mankind has signed definitive agreements to acquire 100% stake in BSV.
We plan to fund this acquisition through a combination of internal accruals and a mix of debt and equity. We expect net debt-to-EBITDA to be not more than 2 times by fiscal '26. Transaction value translates to 22 times to 23 times on EBITDA of fiscal '25.
We expect INR50 crores to INR100 crores synergy benefits to flow through over the next 12 to 24 months. Thus, on fiscal '26 basis, EV EBITDA would approximately land up to 17 times to 18 times , which we believe is an attractive valuation for a super specialty portfolio of BSV 30% plus EBITDA margin, considering BSV's potential of double-digit top line growth and EBITDA margin expansion, we expect EPS accretion from second full year onwards and cash EPS accretion from first full year onwards.
Now coming to Slide 4. Giving a glance on the company. So clearly, over a period of time, it has created big brands. It has 12 brands, about INR25 crores, with the biggest being NTD above INR100 crores. It has a first -- world's first and only recombinant product Anti-D and many first in India like rFSH and HCG. Company has many first-time launches backed by proven capabilities in recombinant technology, niche biologics, complex delivery systems and immunoglobin.
BSV significant focus on women health has 76% share in India and 55% overall with comprehensive fertility portfolio. Coming to the revenues, INR1,723 crores in fiscal '24 split into India and international, 54% and 46%, respectively, which has seen a robust three-year CAGR of 21%. EBITDA margins for BSV has been 28% on adjusted basis. We reported, however, 23%, which is adjusted for [TTK] acquisition, exit-related costs and [ETA] related expenses in fiscal '24.
Coming to Slide number 5. As Rajeev Ji and Sheetal Ji mentioned that the acquisition is in line with our stated acquisition thesis, a high anti-barrier portfolio; b, R&D specialty tech platform; c, complementary portfolio, EBITDA margin accretive acquisition and to unlock synergies.
On a pro forma basis, if we look at the sales mix and EBITDA margins and the brands. These are the three criteria where we look at it. So we see that our domestic business, the focus remains with 87% of forma revenue share brands from 40, we move up to 50 brands about INR50 crores. EBITDA margins if you see the accretion results in excess of 25% EBITDA margins in fiscal '24 pro forma numbers.
If we move to Slide 7, highlighting high-entry barriers specialty pharma portfolio across India and emerging markets. I want to highlight complex portfolio and biologics need 5 to 10 years R&D to develop these products. And MTD stands out because it's the only innovator in the world to develop pretended recombinant.
The other piece I highlight was the big opportunity in the fertility drug. It has presence and a pipeline of 12 out of the 15 top infertility drugs, which is largest among the global peers. Also highlighted on the women health leadership, it has high OTX potential products like Lactare and (inaudible) -- fast-growing India business.
So India business has grown and outperformed the (inaudible) at 1.7 times with more than 9% volume growth. It has been creating large brands, 12 brands with 25% plus crore of sales. Top 10 brands account for 60% of the domestic revenues.
International business has grown at a 25% CAGR in the last three years in constant currency terms and it has developed complex and specialty portfolio in the critical care and fast-growing fertility segment in the International business.
Established R&D platform, three large categories, recombinant tech, we mentioned, niche biologics, (inaudible), complex delivery systems. We have a separate slide on that, we'll just discuss in a minute. Complex manufacturing capabilities, Ambernath facility has five injectable lines with capabilities across recombinant, [equine-based] harmonal and complex delivery systems.
There's also in a US FDA-approved facility in Germany with in-house capabilities in enzymes and hormones. We continue to believe that it will -- the asset will be EBITDA margin accretive given -- and margin improvement to follow through, given the mix changed towards recombinant and higher share of fertility.
Plus, there will be operating leverage, which will flow through -- through sales growth and manufacturing excellence. We also believe that there will be synergies who will boost both top line and profitability, led by Mankind's reach, geographical, doctor reach, sales force reach, higher MR productivity operational excellence in sales and marketing and 75% in-house manufacturing capability to move products in-house for manufacturing.
Slide number 9. We want to highlight three, four key differentiators in the high-tech platform that we are talking about, the high-entry barrier products that we are talking about, NTD stands out. In India, only 5% to 7% eligible mothers are RH negative, which culminates into INR1 crore mothers. So the opportunity is huge as the underpenetration is huge.
The key differentiator is that this product has the presence till 2028. It is vertically integrated through in-house cell lines, and it has recently been awarded with the [pre-Galleon] 2024 in India, which is for the most innovative product. Second product, (inaudible). It is the only ATG product in India for rare disease [plastic anaemia] and has complexity in manufacturing and quality and to maintain the quality of the product.
Polygraph, very excited about this product, given the huge opportunity in the fertility market, it's the first biosimilar of RSH in India, best-in-class. Indication is for infertility in women for revolution stimulation, strong distribution capability with 90% to 100% reach in IVF centers and comprehensive dosage forms, all from the dosage forms were [Pens], PFS and Wiles.
Moving to Slide number 11. I want to highlight the massive opportunity in the fertility market, which has strong structural tailwinds. We have all seen decline in fertility rates driven by lifestyle changes, delayed parenthood and prevalence of chronic diseases. This is leading to rapid scale-up in IVF infrastructure across the country, even Tier 2, Tier 3 cities are also seeing that. This is also coupled with increasing affordability and awareness and improved success rate.
Globally, the market is $6 billion, which is led by players, global players like Merck, (inaudible). If you see there's a huge growth opportunity in these markets as the ideal penetration is still around 1% in emerging markets and in India.
Moving to Slide number 12. BSV, our first full range of women rare life cycle products from fertility to pregnancy and post pregnancy, which is a unique platform. It is one of the few players globally with an exhaustive fertility drug portfolio, which has 12 out of the 15 molecules in this space. Very few players, again, like Merck, Serono, Sharipo and other players like (inaudible) had this kind of capability.
Coming to Slide number 13. It clearly brings us as a leader in the women's health care space with number 1 position in the gynac therapeutic area, which is led by complementary portfolio and coverage expansion, especially in the area of women's health specialty, fertility along with complex critical care products and animal-bite products.
Where Mankind standout is the field force reach and doctor reach and where BSV would help Mankind in the institutional reach. So it's a complementary channel as well. Looking at the fast-growing and limited competition portfolio a few colors on the key brands it has, the clear differentiator here, it has got market dominance in terms of market share. Three of the products where it's a solo player, especially Anti-D (inaudible) and ASVS. Other brands also, if you see, it has only 1 or 2 players. So it has a very limited competition portfolio and most of its key brands are growing upwards of 20%, 25%.
Fertility products, in particular, (inaudible) given the huge growth potential are growing at 30% to 60%, respectively. Moving to international. It has a specialty branded portfolio in the international markets with 2 key home markets, Philippines and Malaysia and present in 15 countries. It has focused presence across 7 brand families, representing 80% of the sales. BSV specialty brand portfolio is scalable with add-on filing potential across the markets.
Moving to Slide 16. We have spoken about the niche R&D debt platform, but I want to highlight about the product pipeline. Not only it has the recombinant NTD first in the world, but it has 2 very interesting biosimilar products in women healthcare, which is under development. Also, in immunoglobin, there are 3 very interesting products in anti-infective as well as antithymocyte products, which are under development.
Coming to Slide 17. I highlighting manufacturing infrastructure with complex capabilities. Ambernath has been a facility which has been there for some time with 5 dedicated injectable lines, capabilities across recombinant [equine-based] harmonal and complex delivery systems. Germany, US FDA-approved [API] plant, which is in-house and also strategic partners partnership with innovators for focused products for 6 key products. This available to land and building adjacent for expansion. There's also upcoming Genovel facility, which can be used for future expansion.
Coming to the synergy benefits on Slide 18. First, the revenue synergies, if you look at, clearly, it can leverage BSV portfolio can leverage -- Mankind's extensive geographical and doctor coverage, which is very expensive with more than 16,000 people on the ground. Mankind has developed unique consumer portfolio. So it has a huge potential to ship products to the OTC channel. BSV's comprehensive fertility portfolio to ensure long runway of growth given structural tailwinds.
Cross-sell opportunity in specialty channels, which are fertility, fertility clinics, institutions. From a cost synergy perspective, we clearly believe that given Mankind capability to improve the BSV MR productivity by leveraging Mankind's operational excellence.
Second, potential shift of outsourced manufacturing for Rx portfolio in Mankind, bringing the products in-house. Leveraging resources across the companies. So multiple synergy levers to accelerate growth and improve margins.
Lastly, a very important slide Slide number 19, which captures how Mankind has transitioned with how Rajeevji articulated in his opening remarks. From starting a mass market portfolio, which has a combination of acute, chronic and semi-chronic business and added and launched specialty chronic portfolio, which is super specialty in cardio, diabeto, CNS and added Mankind consumer business over a period of time.
With BSV, it adds a new layer of growth, which is super specialty, which is sizable, scalable and has high anti-barrier portfolio with specialty R&D tech platform across these unique platforms of recombinant biologics delivery systems.
Hope the above is helpful and now we are open for queries on this transaction.

q-and-a

Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First question for Rajeevji. So while the acquisition kind of fits into what we have been seeing in terms of high-entry barrier specialty business, but we have also stated that we would be focusing on the domestic business and will not be allocating capital towards the exports business, right?
And this kind of piece brings in a decent exposure to exports along with our exports, which have grown multifold in the last one year. So what -- are we kind of digressing up right a year on the strategy [cardio] to just focus on domestic and what kind of incremental capital allocation -- are we kind of expecting for export business or we would just be continuing with what piece we have got and more focus from domestic?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So your question is absolutely right. We've always said that our focus would be on the domestic side. But at the same time, we have always said that whenever there would be opportunity, we'll go for complex difficult to make injectable business.
But here, in this case, sir, you are supposed to really understand, this is a branded business with high entry barrier. It's a very, very specialized business. It's not like -- I mean, you cannot really have a paint export business with me-too as super specialty with the same brush. It is not like that.
It is absolutely different where, I mean, the seller command the price. And in some of the cases, we are the only company going forward and selling the product. That's a difference here. That you're supposed to understand.
So don't really, I mean, think that it's me too -- I mean some kind of a generic business we are doing in export market. It's a branded international business. It's a super specialty business, where sometimes the competition is only with one or two players. It's that kind of a business.
So that's one of the reason, our thesis stands absolutely right. We are India focused, but it doesn't mean when we have a great opportunity like Bharat Serums, which offers us high entry barrier, a super specialty I mean business -- and that to be branded business to not go for it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And for your question about the capital investment in export, right now the investment won't be much because in fertility penetration, even in rest of the world is very minimum. And the scope is huge with the same product, it can grow many for even in emerging market also.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But would it require any investment in, let's say, plant or capacity building?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arjun Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Operating Officer    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So basically, It's Arjun here., there is enough capacity in Bharat Serums. So there is no capital allocation, which would move towards any major R&D or any major plant at manufacturing, et cetera. And I also wanted to highlight that at a blended level, if you see, both Mankind and Bharat Serums put together, the export business would only contribute to 13%. There's not a significant contribution towards the export.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And sir, my second question on the financing of the deal, right, while as we have said it's a mix of cash internal accruals debt and equity. But how are we planning in terms of financing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arjun Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Operating Officer    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, you rightly said. It's going to be a combination of internal accruals and equity and debt -- so what we expect that INR4,000 crore is going to get from the internal accruals. And majorly, the balance will be funded through the debt given that we will ensure that the debt amount should not be more than 2 times of the FY '26 EBITDA and both Mankind and BSV, they have a strong cash generation abilities and the CFO to EBITDA is close to around 70%. With regard to the exact quantum of that, we will determine that between signing and closing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. So as of now, should we exclude equity as a potential financing tool?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we will come out with the definitive numbers as we approach closing. We are exploring various options at the moment. And the exact quantum of that will be known once we approach the closing time line.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. And then a couple of questions, I think, for Prakash (inaudible). You said TTK acquisition adjusted CAGR is around 16%. Is it right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TTK acquisition-adjusted revenue CAGR?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. So the pro forma adjusted for TTK and some COVID sales, it is about 16%, where the breakup is about 9% is the volume growth, around 6% is the price growth and about 1% is the new product growth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abhishek Agarwal, Manchan Pharma - Investor Relation    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the revenue CAGR for the last four years have been upward of 20% for the BSV business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is adjusted for COVID, right? COVID products, which they would.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Perfect. And in terms of the INR90 crores one-off that we have adjusted in EBITDA, 23% was the reported EBITDA margin versus we have said 28% is the adjusted. What is the composition of that INR90 crores?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we are not breaking that out, but there are three key elements as mentioned in the opening. So one is on the TTK acquisition-related expenses. Second is the exit-related expenses by private equity and the (inaudible) related expenses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are clearly nonrecurring, and that's why we are calling it as adjusted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Finance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Securities Limited - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on this deal. Basically, your combined on FY26 in the EBITDA, 17 times to 18 times which implies EBITDA of [INR750] by FY26, broadly 25% year over 24% to 26%. If you could just kind of elaborate in terms of how this growth is going to come from? Is it going to be a base portfolio? Or are we factor any new branches as well into this reduction of?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Sheetalji highlighted, there is a significant product portfolio already invested in and the full potential is not expected. So we believe with the Mankind's operational excellence, reach, et cetera, both in India and international markets, the growth will accelerate, A.
B there is a lot of margin improvement that can happen. We already mentioned about the margins of 28%, moving to 30% plus from '25 to '26 and third is the synergy benefits that would play out the range being INR50 crores to INR100 crores over the next 12 to 18, 24 months, which will be a function of both revenue synergies as well as cost synergies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Securities Limited - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. And with respect to this is R&D's penetration is high what kind of initiative is (technical difficulty).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your voice is not clear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Securities Limited - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it better? As far as this IDS spend reduction is concerned in (inaudible) emerging markets as well as in India. So if you could just share some efforts of BS III into this segment in the past in terms of improving the accessibility of the product, which start to give you confidence for calling up this segment.

Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So basically, Tushar, I mean if you see the penetration of IVF, I mean with the growing lifestyle changes and late marriages, people are having (inaudible) and this problem of infertility is growing. So that is where the market is really underpenetrated.
Having said that, there is a lot of focus in BSV to work with these IVF clinics, not just in India, but globally across these 15 markets, where there is major growth going to come from. It's not just BSV growth, which is going to be there. It's going to be market growth as well, which is a function of -- which is going to result into BSV growth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I can just add there, so the clear proof of the pudding is that if you see polygraphs, which has been growing at 60% CAGR in the last three years and still is only INR35 crores -- so this can become a very big brand going forward. Second example is the (inaudible) HMG, which is growing at 38%, which is INR55 crore brand today. So these are huge long run way of growth in terms of IVF products.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And globally, the market is more than EUR 6 billion, and the current penetration level is less than 1%. So you can see the potential and the (inaudible) of the growth which can maintain in future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Securities Limited - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. That's quite interesting -- so in terms of connect this to, let's say, a year -- so -- if I connect this dots from to the payback period broadly what you would have sort of assumed for this acquisition, if you could share that as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Payback -- so on the payback period, see it's very difficult to call out because it's still in a just happened closing is going to happen in three, four months. What we are comfortable sharing at this point in time is the EPS accretion when it will start. So that's what we are commenting at the moment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arjun Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Operating Officer    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, it's a strategic acquisition and on a long-term basis, and we are very confident that this deal will drive immense value to the shareholders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Securities Limited - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood, sir. And just lastly, on the balance sheet side, if you could help us like in terms of how much is the [spot] and how much is the working capital days for these?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arjun Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Operating Officer    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So based on the diligence, the working capital days are somewhere close to 90 to 100 days cycle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal Securities Limited - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the gross book the intangible assets on the age block.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have to check and come back to will come back to you come back to you on that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So first question I have is on the breakup of India sales. I believe it is around INR900 crores. Is it possible for you to provide how much would be the vaccine sales from this INR900 crores? And how much will be the branded retail sales from this INR900 crores?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So there is no vaccine sales as such. The business is it largely into three segments. One is women health specialty. Second is woman Health Rx and the third is fertility. Fertility is about 10%, 12%. Women health specialty is about 45%, and the remaining is your Rx.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And also just to call out the only vaccine is the (inaudible) vaccine, which accounts for INR40 crores of business in domestic sales.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So is it fair to assume entire INR850 crores or are we knowing that vaccine entire would be the branded generic retail sales basically? When you go to the description?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost 90% of it will be branded sales, branded -- everything is branded. Out of it, 90% would be private market sale and 10% to 15% would be institutional sales.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And second question I have, what is the manufacturing landscape for these products in India at present. I believe most of these products have been launched over the last two to three years, even through Bharat Serums. So it looks like a market which is getting created in India at present. So how do you see how long you believe that this will remain a low competitive market going ahead? Yeah.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So at the moment, the manufacturing landscape is very complex. I think Bharat Serums is one of the very few companies in India and globally to have the capabilities to manufacture such type of products, whether it is in globules or the IVF hormonal products.
But having said that, it's not a question of how tough the manufacturing capabilities are it's a matter of developing the relationship with the doctors because it's not a product which you can launch to develop and launch tomorrow. It's a product which gets sold by winning the trust of the doctors.
Doctors don't start writing such products overnight. I mean, this is a trust, which Bharat Serum has developed over many years. So it's very difficult. I mean, it's very difficult, even if someone is able to manufacture and develop these products, it's very difficult to win doctors trust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. The last question I have on the pricing front because most of these products are at around like [INR3,200] to INR20,000 kind of price range and at present, very limited competition, you have factorizing the pricing erosion going ahead in your estimates or haven't?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the business model, we have taken a price increase of 4% to 5%, which is much conservative versus what you have seen in the past, which is about 6%, 7%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So you don't expect the competition to increase, so that's why you have not factored in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the competition is itself low, I think we believe that this is achievable because if you see the main brands, which we mentioned in one of the slides, in three of them, there is no competition. In three or four of them, there are two to three players.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So there is a good visibility of limited price increase. And also having said that, you need to understand, this is a branded business. It is not a generic business where pricing plays a major role. So doctor's prescription, which matters like how we do our domestic business in the (technical difficulty).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just last question I have then is there a non-competitive arrangement with the promoters of BSV for how long?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are we audible clearly because we can't hear you properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chorus team call us back again because there's a lot of disturbance here which we are receiving. We are going to disconnect. Chorus team can call us back again, please. (technical difficulty).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sir, please go on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. -- we are connected back again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amey Chalke, JM Financial Institutional Securities Limited - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just last question I have on the non-competitive arrangement, whether if it has been signed in the current -- the previous moments of BSV. Pardon?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So this transaction is from a private equity. And normally, the non-competitive clauses for three to four years. So this -- this asset was taken by private equity from the erstwhile promoter between Mankind and the private equity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vishal, B&K. -- (Operator Instructions) Saurabh, (inaudible)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From your remarks, it seems the DNA of BSF is quite difference from Mankind, if it is more (technical difficulty).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saurabh, could you please pick up your headset and ask the question?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So from your remarks, it seems the DNA of BSF is quite different from mankind. It is more oriented towards R&D and innovation. So are you planning to integrate their team with ours? Or do you plan to preserve the culture of BSF, separately? And how do you plan to retain the talent of BSF?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This business is totally different. Their capabilities are total different. So their thought process, DNA has to be different. But they will be complementing Mankind because we don't have this kind of an business capabilities in one go, we have got two things. One, and we'd like to run this company.
I mean as far as the management is concerned, independently, yes, in coming time, there would be a merger. But despite of that, I mean, they would be running this company independently because the different kind of requirements are there different talent is required, different kind of products are required. So on one side, that culture of making sure that there's a proper institutionalization, right things of Mankind really come in there in the team of BSV.
But DNA as far as the working is concerned, should remain as it is right now. And to add to his point, we have acquired the capabilities, capabilities of products, complex products and capabilities of people of BSV. So these will remain separate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And how do you plan to retain that talent?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That will definitely even retain our mean different mechanisms. We have those in the time to come. We'll come through that. I mean, Medical is quite good in retaining talent. I mean look at our background in last 28 or 29 years. People love Mankind. We create this kind of environment. That's the DNA of Mankind actually. The talent is one side. Talent is a mine. The heart is another side.

Surya Narayan, Phillip Capital.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats with a good acquisition. Sir, my first question is on the market presence in the international region. So while we are having a patented molecule, still our market presence in the internet region. Would be restricted to limited areas.
What is the impediment there? And what is the scope for taking it forward further? And why are we -- if that is the kind of strength, why are we restricting or indicating that our expiration for the international market business would be limited only.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the patented molecule, which is anti-D, it was initially developed for India market, and slowly, it started progressing towards other markets. It still hasn't received its approval in a lot of these countries. But having said that, I mean the idea is to increase the focus and get approval of anti-D in these 15 international markets.
And also, we plan over the next four, five years to take it further into ROW and developed markets. There are about 20 ROW markets were filing is in process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. (inaudible) progress that is on?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your voice is breaking.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is on for the other market and that will take us to those markets subsequently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. My second question is on the growth of the business segment and the broader segment as you have indicated, 10%, 45% and 45% Rx and ABH. So in terms of the profit profile of the business, whether it is -- which would be the best and or how different would be the margin profile of this business, even if you give some qualitative aspect understanding point of view, that is also fine. That is one.
And related an extended question about it is that in the opening remark, you mentioned that in the last two years, the growth has been like phenomenal and it is not only in the revenues. On the margin front, also, there is a kind of significant improvement.
So what would have led to this kind of progression? And is it only led by the prices or it is volume supported also -- and can you continue the similar kind of progression, both in terms of growth as well as margin improvement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As highlighted, the entire portfolio is high entry barrier portfolio with an element of super specialty. So super specialty assets that you see have high gross margins. That's why as the penetration and growth is increasing on these products, the EBITDA margin and gross margins have been improving.
And at the same time, there is a lot of efficiency, which has been built into cost which has led to increase in the margin profile. And there are certain high-margin products with high growth, especially anti-D, those kind of products have led to increase in profit margins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it fair to believe, sir, this IT would be the highest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [75]

(Operator Instructions) Gagan Thareja, ASK Investments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gagan Thareja, ASK Investments - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope I'm audible. I have two questions. So one is can you split up the total purchase value into fixed assets, intangibles, goodwill and also give us some idea of what the depreciation and amortization value can be.
Second, even at the FY27 guidance that you're giving of the EBITDA, the ROC still remain a purchase, are you still remain perhaps a mid to between a 5% to 10% sort of in ROC. So just trying to understand how do you see this evolving because buying of CV ROC, age of purchase value looks low.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I take the ROCE question. So if you look at BSV's ROCE Is currently in the region of 15% to 18%. And we expect with improving margin profile and growth profile. It will move to 20% to 25% in next two to three years. If you look at Mankind, Mankind ROCE is 30% plus. So if you look at combined ROCE adjusted for goodwill, it would be in the region of 20%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gagan Thareja, ASK Investments - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, but goodwill would release the value goodwill is the value you are paying for it, right? So inclusive of goodwill, the ROC will still remain low, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So for the allocation, I'll ask Ashutosh to cover.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ashutosh Dhawan, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Financial Officer    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, that's a good question. And as we highlighted that it's a super specialty R&D type platform. And there are patents also in this business, and it's a combination of branded formulation, critical care and super specialty business.
So we will be carrying out the purchase price allocation exercise. And basis that, we will be doing the apportionment between how much to be allocated towards the intangibles and how much towards the goodwill.
So that's an exercise which we intend to take out when we approach the closing or immediately after the closing. So if you ask me the broad rule of thumb, it's very difficult to define the split at this stage. But broadly, given this is a high-quality and super speciality business, we are fairly confident that the allocation towards the intangibles will be higher. Majority of the portion will be allocated towards the intangibles in the business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gagan Thareja, ASK Investments - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And if I understand it correctly, I think in your presentation, also indicated that 40% of portfolio in India is under price control. Is that the case? And if that is so, does it not sort of constrain you in terms of pricing power?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ashutosh Dhawan, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Financial Officer    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are right that 40% is there, but that's pricing agnostic because at the same time, the pricing is higher -- and there is a headroom available between the MRP and the average sale price. So having said that, historically, BSV has been able to take price increase close to 6% on a year-on-year basis, and that has resulted in the pricing efficiency, which you have seen in the EBITDA improvement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See does you have to see that these products have very limited competition, unlike branded generic, for example, when they enter and then there's -- suddenly, there is like you saw in diabetes, one or two MNC player, and then there are a host of 30 players coming in even in the branded generic market.
This, you have to take it as a super specialty business, where the competition remains two to three at best and maybe one to two to start with. So the pricing power on these and the volume growth given the low competition is significantly higher.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arjun Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Operating Officer    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And at the overall level, if you see, as we have highlighted for Mankind, so our NAV exposure is close to 14.5%. At the overall level, it may go up to 17%, 18% -- so 82% is still no, no, (inaudible).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gagan Thareja, ASK Investments - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And are the exports targeted only at the ROW -- or are you going to look at exports in the regulated markets as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, it has been targeted in ROW emerging market, mainly focusing in our ROW market.

Alankar Garude, Kotak Institutional Equities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats to the team on the deal. First question, you spoke about 30% plus EBITDA margins in FY26. So and also alluded to the fact that the gross margins for BSV are pretty high. So based on your current assessment and taking into account those 4%, 5% price hikes plus synergies and efficiencies high growth, what could be the peak EBITDA margin for BSV?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Alankar, just 1 point before we start answering that. So the domestic business gross margins are significantly higher. The second point is what are the margin levers is a question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The peak EBITDA margin based on your current assessment for the overall entity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So this business can continue to see 100 basis points to 200 basis points margin improvement year-on-year given that the growth will improve, operational efficiency will improve then there will be synergistic benefits. So on an overall basis, we can believe that every year, there would be margin improvement. And there will be new technology-based products also coming in, which will again improve the margins.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. And when you say, Prakash, domestic gross margins are significantly higher -- and can you just broadly bifurcate what is the difference between domestic and international gross margins for this portfolio?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So basically, if you see the branded generic gross margins of domestic business, it is a little better. So that was the point that I was trying to make.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second one is a clarification on the historical organic growth. You spoke about 16% earlier -- and then there was also a mention about 20%. So can you clarify that? And the 16% or 20% is over what time frame?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So. The 16% is from the India business pro forma basis, 25% is for the international business. Blended basis, it is about 20%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And this is over how many years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last three years. '21 to '24.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So there, Prakash, the base would also be a bit low, right, because these were COVID years. So if you can help us with maybe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. We can take that offline. So, just to clarify, two numbers are floating around 1 is 16, second is 20. 20 is the reported or the actual growth registered 16 is the adjusted for COVID and the other acquisition. So that's how you have to look at it Alankar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So basically, it's 20% reported overall growth for BSV and 16% is the adjusted growth for the acquisition as well as COVID? Correct. Over the three-year time frame?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Prashant Kothari], Pictet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, sir, my question is looking at the history of BSV, the growth rates were pretty low before Advent came in, the growth rate was like to be 8%, 10% type annually. And then it has suddenly come up to what earlier 16% or 20%.
My concern would be how much due diligence that you've done on the sales that you have recognized this really kind of dumping has happened in the market I mean because private equity can be kind of a bit bad in terms of trying to address the company and then select (inaudible) specially given the fact they're coming out of it in kind of only four, five years, so just wanted to understand your process of due diligence before we have signed up for this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This, I mean, we have done a good diligence in this. We are from the market side as well. We know inside story of earlier Bharat Serums and this Bharat Serums we know the management we are absolutely confident that this two extra dumping is not being taken place. And apart from this, we have our most some numbers of this quarter as well. That also reflects that, things are right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the approach has been both internal as well as external. For external, we engaged with one of the big 3 for the commercial and the revenue diligence. So it was a proper due diligence exercise, which was carried out a combination of big 3, big 4 and the big law firms. So this was an extensive process which we went through over the last two months' time frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What led to the sales inflection after advance came in?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What's the question. Why the inflection, why the sales growth happened after...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Juneja, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, Managing Director    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See when it was held by the previous promoters. It was a very mismanaged business. They had good products, but they were very mismanaged. And Advent came in, they brought in new management, new team came in to run this business.
And there was a lot of costs which were taken out and a lot of products which were there in R&D, which were shared products which were relevant were developed and a lot of effort was put into marketing these good quality products.
So there was -- I mean it was a company which had good products, a good engine, but it was mismanaged. So they basically came in with the new leadership who could manage the business well, and that's where the growth came in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alankar Garude, Kotak Securities (Institutional Equities) - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And sir, in the domestic business margins, would they be kind of somewhere between a typical chronic business, margin and active business margin? Would they fall somewhere in that range?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheetal Arora, Mankind Pharma Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, Whole-Time Director    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, in that range.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prakash Agarwal, Mankind Pharma Ltd - President (Strategy)    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Please write to us for any further clarification and queries. Thank you. Have a nice day.
