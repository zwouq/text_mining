Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kane Biotech announced yesterday that it had come to an agreement with the shareholders of FB Dermatology for the acquisition of the entire company. So exciting times at Kane, once again. Rob, what are you most excited about regarding this transaction?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the first thing that excites me a lot is we're executing on the plan that we've laid out to the shareholders. So we've had a chance to meet a lot of you over this past year, talking about the plans for Kane and this fits perfectly in our strategy. So we're executing on the plan which is going to help both patients and shareholders.
And then I like the technology as well. I have to be honest. I'm excited by it for a couple of different reasons. First is it's actually stimulating our immune system. So wounds will heal faster using a patented technology. And then secondly, I think there's actually a direct impact on biofilm as well too. So it plays really nicely into Kane's mission statement in terms of impacting biofilm through this technology. So a lot of cool things from a science point of view and from a shareholder point of view as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fantastic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think people may have questions. What exactly are we buying?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're buying a great company. And why is it a great company? Because it's a proven and patented technology. And when I say proven, there are a number of publications, case studies, clinical trials that really demonstrate the efficacy of this technology both in wounds and in skin conditions such as Acne and Rosacea.
We're acquiring a couple of million dollars' worth of revenue in Europe and Australia and New Zealand. We're applying a technology that is not only proven but approved in Europe. So LumiHeal and Kleresca both have C Marks and LumiHeal actually has a new MDR, which is required for commercialization in Europe. And we'll pursue that for Kleresca going forward down the road. And a small team mainly focused on commercialization, which is really where Kane is at right now is the commercialization phase of the company.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Kane is primarily focused on North America with new distributorships and stuff like that. So where is that -- where's the commercialization happening here with FB Dermatology?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the commercialization is happening in Europe. The team have done a good job of putting together some distribution agreements to get these market -- these products into the European market. And they've assembled a small commercial team in Australia and New Zealand.
And what's exciting is as we were having these discussions, we've already started, for example, getting regulatory approval for our revived antimicrobial wound gel. And we've started having discussions with some of the larger groups regarding our DermaKB shampoo and think that there's some real potential -- as we build the commercial strategy, there's some real potential for all of Kane's products as we move forward, including, eventually, DispersinB, when it comes to enhancing the current treatments regarding acne.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome. So this seems to me to be another example of great technology developed by the Bellini family and it seems like a great deal for Kane as well. So why is that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a really good question. I -- you're absolutely right. I think if we look at biochem pharma, we look at the BELLUS Health, the Bellinis have had multiple multibillion dollar exits. I'm a big believer that this is another world-class technology, but the reality is that it's focused in wound care and in wound care the big players, the people that can afford to acquire a technology like this, want to see some commercial traction, which is really where Kane has landed with their technologies.
So I think this will be a very synergistic symbiotic relationship as the Bellinis become shareholders in Kane and we deliver some great shareholder value. What appears to be a great -- what is a great price for Kane today should deliver some good returns for the Bellinis nonetheless.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice. So this is really a case of not one plus one equals two, but one plus one equals three.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm working hard to make it -- to make that true, Rob.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice. So we put out the press release yesterday. We've had a lot of attraction and incoming comments from people. I'm just going to read some of the questions if I can and have you answer them. So what about capital commitments for FB Dermatology in the context of the deal or after the deal?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we're expecting the company to be cash flow positive next year. And I'm bold enough to think that we can actually -- our future payments that are owed, that we can generate the money within FB Dermatology to actually be able to make those two milestone payments. However, in the short term, I'd expect that we'll probably need about EUR500,000 to get there. So that's a very, very reasonable amount to get to a cash flow positive business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So a lot of it depends on the commercial activity. What are the -- what are the margins like?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the margins are very good. I won't go into the specifics of it for commercial reasons, but the margins are very, very good. They vary a little bit per technology and per country, but we won't -- margins will not be an issue with the with this technology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then we've expanded the footprint of Kane dramatically through this deal. How are we planning to deal with the commercial activities? Are we building sales force? Are we using more distributorships?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think a little bit of both. I think the main focus will be distributorships and strategic partnerships as we move forward. In certain markets, however, we may build a commercial sales force. FB Dermatology already has a great team which we've had the pleasure of meeting a few times via teleconference and want to build on that team, want to expand on that team. Canada might have a small sales force as well, but mainly through distributorships and strategic partnerships.
And the beauty is that when we look at FB Dermatology's technology such as Lumixa, we've been having multiple conversations with our partner, Omni Bioceuticals, and they really think they can help us get into business with some of the KOLs, especially the companies that manufacture these lights because we're providing a consumable to go with that hardware investment. It's really a nice combination there where they sell the lights and then they can get some recurring revenue by selling the FLE gel. I think there's some real great opportunity there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we've talked about expanding Kane more globally; let's bring it back home to North America. For the FB Dermatology technology, any US reimbursement yet or --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, like I mentioned earlier, it does have a C Mark. It is approved in Europe. We're going to expand that footprint to get more reimbursement within Europe. There are a few countries today such as Greece that are reimbursing LumiHeal.
But -- and in the US, they do have 510(k) De Novo for LumiHeal for surgical scar reduction. We're going to continue to -- we want to continue to invest in the technology to get that wound healing certification and get that reimbursement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And what about sales projections? Peak estimates?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So there are a number of products. I won't get into all of them, but there's some real potential here. When I look at LumiHeal, which is the wound care technology. I think our go to market will be -- our go-to-market strategy will be very similar to what Sanuwave is doing with UltraMIST. And today, they've got a hardware component, they've got a consumable component and are able to generate close to $30 million in recurring revenue through that technology. And I think they're just getting started. So it's all about having a great technology and some really solid reimbursement. I think we've got the first step, and we'll work hard to deliver the second.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice. So all this technology is new to the Kane investor family. Any KOLs that are using the product right now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of KOLs that are really passionate about this technology, LumiHeal and Kleresca in particular. I think if we -- the different publications, clinical trials, and so on and so forth show the incredible potential of this technology.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice. Well, I'm excited by the announcement. I'm excited by bringing this technology into Kane and what we can do with this. We've had a chance to meet some of the people with FB Dermatology the last few days. It's a really exciting times for patients and shareholders of Kane. Any final words?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. I think this is an incredible opportunity for Kane. As you said earlier, we've put together a plan and we're delivering on that plan, and I think investors and shareholders and the Kane team, and everybody can expect to see more of that going forward. We'll be launching our revived antimicrobial wound gel spray in the coming weeks. We will be kicking off our acne proof of concept clinical trial at the University of Miami before the end of the year. So some really key milestones that will -- we're executing on the plan that we put forward.
You're a big part of that, Robert. Thank you for helping us do this and it's been great having you on board and exciting times. And thanks for sitting in with me this morning and bringing the investors up to speed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Huizinga, Kane Biotech Inc - Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the opportunity. Appreciate it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc Edwards, Kane Biotech Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. So we'll be back to you soon with more videos. Have a great day.
