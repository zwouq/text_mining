Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining the Tempest Therapeutics and Millendo Therapeutics call. (Operator Instructions) As a remainder, today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Louis Arcudi, CEO of Millendo. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louis J. Arcudi,  Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. Thank you, John, for that, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today is Tom Hoover from my team and also Tom Dubensky and Steve Brady from the Tempest team. I'm very excited to announce that, following an extensive and thorough review of our strategic alternatives, Millendo and Tempest have agreed to merge. Focusing on advancing Tempest's potential first-in-class oncology pipeline of small molecule therapeutics and the potential to address a wide range of tumors. So if we look at Slide 2, I have to do my legal public announcement, you will see that and you will be reminded that our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but not limited to, statements about the proposed merger, including statements regarding satisfaction of the conditions to and consumption of the merger, confirmation of the merger agreement, the expected ownership of the combined company and the expected benefits of the proposed merger. 
Our actual results may differ materially from these described. We encourage you to read our filings with the SEC when they become available. Including our registration statement that will include a proxy statement and prospectus of the documents that will contain important information about both companies and the transactions and participants' interest in the transactions. These documents will be made available free of charge by contacting either of the companies or visiting the SEC website, www.sec.gov. 
As you recall, earlier this year, Millendo had announced the initiation of a process to evaluate a range of strategic alternatives. After a comprehensive review of these options, we are confident that the proposed merger provides the best path forward in that it will deliver immediate and significant potential value to Millendo shareholders. 
While Steve and Tom will provide more information shortly, let me take a quick opportunity to introduce you to Tempest. Tempest is a clinically staged oncology company advancing small molecule therapies that combine both targeted and immune-mediated mechanisms with the potential to treat a wide range of tumors. 
The Tempest team has observed early signs of clinical activities in their programs. And importantly, the combined company will also be well capitalized with significant resources to advance their product candidates through what could be key data readouts. The combined company will take the name Tempest Therapeutics. In our review, the combined company -- in our view, that combined company will benefit not only from the value of Tempest's compelling pipeline, but also from its dedicated and experienced leadership team, with highly relevant scientific, clinical, business, transactional and regulatory personnel. 
I want to actually take some time now to personally recognize and thank all the employees at Millendo, the Board of Directors of Millendo and our shareholders, who support and is enabling us to actually go into this transformational transaction. 
Please note, in addition to the press release issued this morning, we have included the presentations, the slides in the webcast of today's call and have posted on PDF of the slides of both companies on our websites. We encourage you to access these slides to follow along with today's discussion. 
Again, I will now turn the call over to Steve and Tom, who will share more about the exciting therapies being developed at Tempest and the company's path forward. Steve, Tom?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Brady,   -     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Lou. We're pleased to enter into this agreement with Millendo, which when closed, will transition Tempest into a public company and enhance our ability to fund what we believe are an exciting pipeline of potential oncology therapies. 
Before we discuss the programs, we'll turn to Slide #3 and a summary of the transaction. As Lou mentioned, the combined company will operate as Tempest Therapeutics and will be listed on NASDAQ under the ticker TPST. Our proposed merger is an all-stock transaction, which will value Millendo at $36 million at the closing of the transaction, which equates to a substantial premium over Millendo's projected net cash at that time. 
On completion, Millendo shareholders will own approximately 18.5% of the issued shares of the combined company, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement. The company will be headquartered at Tempest offices and labs in South San Francisco, and the Board will be comprised of 7 members: one nominated by Millendo and the balance by Tempest. The rest of the Tempest team will continue in their current positions. 
The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the boards of both Millendo and Tempest. We anticipate the transaction will close in the first half of 2020 (sic) [2021], subject to the approval of the stockholders of each company and the satisfaction of other customary conditions. 
Now turning to Slide #4. Let's dig into the Tempest story and opportunity. This team has come together to build an integrated company, ranging from discovery stage programs through late clinical development and eventually commercialization. We believe the Tempest team has the experience and track record to increase the likelihood of success and that the individual components of this company combine to provide a potentially compelling opportunity for investors, a fulfilling environment for employees and ultimately, to produce meaningful therapies for patients. 
We're fortunate to have a diverse pipeline of product candidates that are already showing early clinical benefit, and if approved, we believe could have significant commercial potential. As well as the research expertise in this company that we believe provides fertile ground to expand the pipeline with potentially first-in-class product candidates. 
The combination of this pipeline and a team who can execute provides an opportunity that we believe offers significant news flow and multiple potential catalysts through this year and 2022. As Slide #5 lays out, TPST-1495 and TPST-1120 are our 2 clinical programs targeting the EP2 and EP4 receptors at PPAR-alpha, respectively. Tempest also has an exciting preclinical program targeting TREX1 in the STING pathway. 
These clinical programs are supported by a significant amount of positive preclinical data, are progressing through both monotherapy and combination studies and are showing early signs of clinical benefit, which we'll be highlighting briefly this morning. 
On this Slide #6 and the next slide, you can see that we're fortunate to have the right team in place to increase Tempest's probability of success. First, the company has assembled a high-functioning management team with relevant experience across the different components of a development stage biotech company, which will continue to supplement over time with additional expertise as our programs progress. 
On Slide #7, we're also fortunate to have a top-tier board and group of investors who have consistently supported Tempest from its inception through this transaction. 
I'll now hand this over to Tom as we move to our first program, TPST-1495, that, as I mentioned, targets both the EP2 and 4 receptors in the prostaglandin pathway.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas W. Dubensky,  Tempest Therapeutics Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Steve. I will now provide a brief summary of the Tempest pipeline. Beginning with our first clinical program shown on Slide 9, TPST-1495 targets the prostaglandin pathway, which is known to be a driver of a diverse set of malignancies and also resistance to immune therapies. Prostaglandin signals through 4 receptors that are present on both tumor cells and immune cells. 
To leverage this pathway, we believe, and the literature supports this notion, that a therapeutic agent should leave both EP1 and EP3 receptors alone because signaling through these pathways supports antitumor immunity. In contrast, signaling through the EP2 and EP4 receptors, both supports tumor growth and suppression of the immune system. There have been several agents already in clinical development targeting only the EP4 receptor, unnecessary, but we believe insufficient step. After a difficult mid-chemistry effort that points to the overall expertise of our team, Tempest designed TPST-1495 to selectively block both EP2 and EP4 prostaglandin receptors. 
And based on our preclinical data and emerging clinical data, we're very excited about the potential of this molecule. In preclinical studies, we have observed that TPST-1495 has significant tumor-killing and antitumor immune effects across multiple models as compared to single EP4 antagonists currently into clinical development. 
Slide #10 shows the results of an exciting experiment comparing the antitumor activity of TPST-1495 to single EP4 antagonists, and this is in a spontaneous model -- tumor model that recapitulates certain aspects of human colorectal cancer. 
In this experiment, which has been repeated several times by our collaborator, we have shown that TPST-1495 as monotherapy significantly reduces both tumor size and inhibits the development of tumors in a small intestine of this model. 
Moving on to our clinical experience with TPST-1495 on Slide 11, early in the program, we observed high drug exposures and pharmacokinetics, also known as PK, with a profile that supported switching from our starting dose schedule of twice a day to once daily, a preferred dosing regimen. 
With the once-daily dose schedule, 1495 has been progressing through a monotherapy study, and the team believes we are narrowing in on a dose and schedule that would be appropriate for potential monotherapy expansion and combination studies. 
On Slide #12, you can see not only how tight the PK profiles are between patients given the same dose, but also something important related to how Tempest believes its molecule should be developed. The team has designed the clinical program to optimize Cmax while allowing Cmin to drop below the IC50 value for the EP4 receptor signaling. 
We believe that this dosing strategy we have adopted will allow us to both optimize antitumor activity as well as gut mucosa remodeling, which should support longer-term drug tolerability. 
This slide and the next slide, #13, provide that not only can we measure the pharmacodynamic effect of TPST-1495 in 2 different ways, the first 4 patients that we treated at this once-daily dose and a schedule of interest, all had tumor marker reductions and some disease control, including tumor reduction in patients who had received several prior therapies. 
The safety of this molecule is comprised of Grade 1-2 related adverse events. Although we are early in the program at these dose levels, the team is looking forward to generating more data as this program progresses. 
Now on Slide #15, I'll switch gears and summarize our second clinical program, known as TPST-1120. TPST-1120 is a potentially first-in-class antagonist of a transcription factor known as PPAR-alpha. PPAR-alpha controls the expression of about 100 genes that are relevant to tumor growth, development of blood vessels and to support immune evasion of tumors. 
As tumors grow and become metastatic, the tumor becomes starved for oxygen and the tumor cells switch to [polymetabolize] to support their own growth. The genes that are controlled by this PPAR-alpha transcription factor enable tumor cells to metabolize fat. This same metabolic pathway known as fatty acid oxidation, importantly, also promotes angiogenesis and supports suppressive immune cells in the tumor. 
There is strong literature support, particularly in liver cancer models that inhibition of PPAR-alpha inhibits tumor growth and importantly, may combine well with agents that inhibit either angiogenesis or block immune checkpoints or both. 
Now moving on to Slide #16. This is an example of several experiments conducted by Tempest demonstrating that TPST-1120 has significant antitumor activity in preclinical models. 
Using publicly available databases, we found that human kidney cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and liver cancer expressed comparatively high levels of PPAR-alpha and its target genes. 
Shown in Slide 16, we assess the activity of TPST-1120 in a tumor model of liver cancer that is driven by a pathway known as Wnt/beta-catenin. Activation of this pathway is known to occur at significant levels in human liver cancer and frequently has mutations that have shown to make these tumors reliant on the metabolic pathway we are inhibiting with TPST-1120. In this experiment, we found that monotherapy with either TPST-1120 or an immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody inhibited tumor growth at comparable levels. 
In combination, we observed real synergy. The tumors rapidly shrank. And as you can see, these mice have long-term durable cures. The results of this study really have informed our clinical development and, again, underline the importance of the PPAR-alpha in tumor growth and evasion of immune recognition. 
Turning to Slide #17. I'll summarize our ongoing Phase I clinical study with TPST-1120 and then discuss some exciting news that we've recently announced. We completed the monotherapy dose escalation and observed stable disease in a high-frequency of patients who've had multiple prior therapies. For example, we observed tumor reduction but not reaching RECIST criteria and long-term survival up to 9 months in 2 patients with cholangiocarcinoma. 
The molecule is also very well tolerated. In addition, we were very excited to announce recently a clinical collaboration with Roche/Genentech to Test TPST-1120 in a global randomized clinical study in frontline hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. The respective companies have already submitted regulatory documents, and we expect that this clinical study will initiate in previously untreated HCC patients in the middle of this year. 
This randomized study will compare the response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival of the triplet therapy, including TPST-1120 to the doublet standard of care therapy. The mechanism of action of inhibiting PPAR-alpha in combination with these 2 agents has strong scientific rationale and is supported by both the literature and by preclinical studies with TPST-1120 conducted by Tempest and our collaborators. 
This frontline collaboration accelerates the development of this program by several years, and we are thrilled to be working with the Roche/Genentech team. 
Now turning to Slide #18, we would like to share with you an encouraging clinical results of 1 of our patients that was treated or is being treated with TPST-1120 and the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab. The patient is a 54-year-old woman with late-line renal cell carcinoma, who have received 3 prior lines of therapy and had not achieved a clinical response by RECIST criteria. 
In this patient, after treatment with TPST-1120, we observed a deep partial response by RECIST criteria, with an overall reduction of 54% of her tumor burden and all target lesions shrinking. 
She is feeling well and importantly, is still on therapy. We are encouraged by this response because not only was it a deep partial response, but because she had previously received the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab and did not have a RECIST response. In addition, she did not respond to those 2 subsequent therapies before coming on to our clinical study. As a reminder, renal cell cancer is a tumor known to be reliant on the PPAR-alpha pathway, and we are targeting -- that we are targeting with TPST-1120.
Now on Slide #19, where we wrap up the TPST-1120 program by saying that we are encouraged by both the monotherapy and combination clinical benefit observed to date, and we are excited about the acceleration of this program via our collaboration with Roche/Genentech. 
On Slide 21, I'll briefly summarize a preclinical exciting program targeting TREX1, which is in the STING pathway. The STING pathway has strong scientific validation, but has been difficult to drug clinically. The field of innate immunity has moved largely to systemic therapies, which we believe makes sense given the unique immune target profiles of individual tumors in metastatic disease. However, STING is expressed everywhere, which makes systemic targeting a challenge. In contrast, TREX1 is expressed at higher levels in tumors, where this pathway is actually hijacked by tumors to limit the activation of the STING pathway and then immune recognition, which would normally provide an antitumor effect. 
So we believe the right approach to target the STING pathway is to target the upstream exonuclease enzyme in this pathway, known as TREX1 with an inhibitor that could broadly and selectively activate STING in the tumor microenvironment with an orally administered small molecule drug. We're in the lead optimization stage with our TREX1 program and expect to select a development candidate by the end of this year and file an IND by the end of 2022. 
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the mic back over to you, Steve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Brady,   -     [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide #22, which has the potential news flow and catalysts from our pipeline that our pipeline may produce in the near term. We believe the pipeline is comprised of high-quality product candidates that are being managed by a team of experienced professionals, importantly, with a track record of execution. 
We believe this results in a diversified opportunity for investors and potentially significant news flow from multiple studies for the balance of this year and into 2022, including in target histologies of interest, such as TPST-1495 in colorectal cancer and TPST in front-line hepatocellular carcinoma pursuant to the Roche/Genentech collaboration that Tom just discussed. 
Finally, turning to Slide #29 (sic) [Slide #23], with respect to next steps on this transaction. Tempest and Millendo expect to file an SEC registration document and related shareholder information ahead of a Millendo shareholder vote in the first half of this year, with the transaction closing as soon as possible thereafter. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now happy to open the call for Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Ted Tenthoff from Piper Sandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edward Andrew Tenthoff,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the merger.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Ted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edward Andrew Tenthoff,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for going through the pipeline. It sounds really exciting. Just a high-level question. Can you tell us about any biomarker work that you're doing either around 1495 or 1120? And the program or T-REX program or TREX program, it sounds really exciting. When do you think that might be able to enter the clinic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas W. Dubensky,  Tempest Therapeutics Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Ted. This is Tom Dubensky. And 
(technical difficulty) 
we can modulate that level of prostaglandin following TPST-1495. The other aspects in that program that we are observing is that we see real potent immune activation in an ex vivo whole blood assay we conduct as a surrogate for drug exposure. So very excited about that. 
And as I mentioned, depending on the disease and the patients we're treating, there are well-known tumor-specific biomarkers which we have observed reduction in the 1-daily dosing in patients that are on study. 
Moving on to TPST-1120, we have a couple of interesting biomarkers that we assess to understand the activity of our drug and also the activity in potential -- potential activity in the patients we're treating. 
First of all, with the drug itself, we measure lipid levels, long-chain fatty acid levels and do some transcriptome analysis that did show us that we're hitting our target. 
Then we look at disease-specific biomarkers. In particular, in our ongoing study with hepatocellular carcinoma, there are publicly available tests to interrogate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. And so ultimately, what we hope to be able to achieve in our ongoing trials and then in our collaboration with Roche/Genentech, is to ask what the mutation profile is in this beta -- Wnt catenin pathway and how that correlates to any potential clinical response. 
And then just a final answer to your question around our TREX1 program, very excited about it, first-in-human potentially, and we anticipate filing an IND at the end of next year. And hopefully, we'll be in the clinic in early 2023.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question is from Matt Phipps from William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Christopher Phipps,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Biotechnology Research Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Steve, Tom, congrats. Sorry, Tom, it might have in my line that cut out, but I missed this bit. Have you considered using PGM -- high levels of urinary PGM as like an enrollment criteria at all in the dual antagonist studies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas W. Dubensky,  Tempest Therapeutics Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Matt, it's good to hear from you. And yes, and the prior question from Ted Tenthoff touched on that a bit. And just to let you know, again, PGEM is a stable metabolite of prostaglandin. And what we're doing, both looking at the literature and then also in our patients themselves is having -- really profiling our patients, both at baseline as a function of what their disease is and then measuring PGEM levels in the urine by mass spec over a course of therapy. 
And what I can say is that we certainly have been able to modulate PGEM levels in response to therapy. And we hope that, that will really give us insight for patient selection in subsequent studies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Christopher Phipps,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Biotechnology Research Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. And then on the 1120 in cholangio, did you look at kind of comutations or any mutations in those patients, anything like FGFR or IDH in terms of that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas W. Dubensky,  Tempest Therapeutics Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, that's a really good question, and Matt -- and that's 1 reason why we highlighted cholangiocarcinoma on our discussion today, and it's something that we've analyzed closely in our patients. And in fact, we've treated several patients on the study in late-line cholangiocarcinoma, which, as you know, in late-line progresses really very quickly. 
And what we've been encouraged by is that the patients that seem to do the best did have IDH mutations. And as you know, IDH does -- is in the metabolic pathway and it intersects with the fatty acid oxidation pathway. So one could imagine possible combination therapies with IDH inhibitors that are emerging as a treatment paradigm. And again, certainly, we have encouraging data that patients with IDH mutations, which makes complete scientific rationale, respond -- responded better to TPST-1120 in a small handful of patients.
