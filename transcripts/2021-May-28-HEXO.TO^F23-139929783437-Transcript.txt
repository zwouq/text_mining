--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call on short notice. I'm very excited to be speaking with you this morning as we celebrate a defining moment in HEXO's history. I'm joined on the call this morning by Pete and Will Montour of Redecan; and Trent MacDonald, CFO of HEXO. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Redecan, the largest privately owned and one of the most profitable licensed producers in the Canadian cannabis industry. 
A few years ago, HEXO set a course to become 1 of the top 3 cannabis players in the Canadian adult-use market. We recognize that scale and the defensible portfolio of brands with high customer loyalty were prerequisites to creating durable competitive advantage. We've achieved and exceeded this objective. Following the close of this transaction, HEXO will be the Canadian recreational market leader with a deep national house of brands in a straightforward path for positive earnings and cash flow generation. We set out to become top 3. Today, we positioned HEXO as #1. For those of you who don't know Redecan, it may be the easily best kept secret in the industry to many investors. But it's a clear favorite amongst Canadian cannabis consumers. 
Redecan is the largest private Canadian LP, and on a stand-alone basis, excluding Quebec, the third largest LP by adult-use market share. As you know, HEXO was top 3 overall. The team at Redecan has developed Redees, the #1 pre-roll in Canada by a big margin. They boast market leadership in differentiated cannabis derivative products, such as oils and capsules. Their products are known for quality and consistency. And according to Brightfield, the Redecan the highest customer loyalty metrics in the Canadian industry. 
The company is known for doing things differently. Its operating team is lean and has driven impressive results through a relentless focus on efficiency, the consistent application of technology and automation as well as proprietary and innovative manufacturing processes. The Redecan can acquisition reinforces and complements HEXO's strengths perfectly. It expands our western presence and makes us the largest LP by national market share with leadership in the country's most populous provinces. We are #1 in Ontario. We're #1 in BC. We're #1 in Quebec, and we're #1 in Alberta. Combined with HEXO's current suite of brands, the addition of Redecan gives us the deepest brand portfolio in the market. 
By combining our product portfolios and distribution, we'll have the largest share of the Canadian adult-use market with brands and products that address all price points and form factors. Our combined portfolio is highly defensible and diversified with plenty of room to grow. Further, this transaction provides us with readily accessible synergies by expanding Redecan products into our stronghold market of Quebec, leveraging Redecan proprietary technology across all our operations, and it also offers up the opportunity for a reduction in overlapping costs. 
With our objectives to become one of the top 3 players in Canada achieved, it sets HEXO up to the next stage in our growth story, both domestically as well as on the global stage. I'd like to give a very warm welcome to Pete Montour of Redecan who will be joining our HEXO Board. Pete?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pete Montour,   -     [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Sebastien. It is a pleasure to be here. After 5 years running Redecan and creating very successful profit (technical difficulty) LP, we recognize the time it come to become part of something larger in order to continue Redecan's successful track record again, (technical difficulty) globally. Our team reviewed several opportunities to support the fund growth internally as well as to partner with others. And when we got deeper with HEXO, we realized very quickly that this deal is far and away the best fit both to enable Redecan to continue growing in the Canadian market as well as to begin attacking the international opportunities. At the core of this transaction is a shared set of operating price and alignment around the correct assets and strategy required to build the global cannabis company that will create enduring value for all shareholders. 
HEXO's geographic footprint and product portfolio perfectly complements our own, and we see the opportunity for meaningful revenue synergies as we integrate our 2 organizations and begin to fully leverage the power of our regional distribution networks. HEXO has also taken the time and invested the capital to build a best-in-class operating footprint and a robust support infrastructure that is required to maintain and accelerate growth as a true national player. We expect the combined companies to benefit very quickly from this complementary infrastructure. And one example I'd highlight is the ability to port Redecan through HEXO's cutting-edge Belleville center. 
Sebastien and the HEXO team recognize the value of portfolio concentration and share our view as building a stronghold market foundation is imperative to form meaningful international expansion. Our combined company will be a dominant player in Canada. We expect by combining the companies together, we'll be better able to profitably leverage our foundation to drive future growth in the U.S. when legally permissible as well as internationally. 
HEXO and Redecan are aligned in their approach to the consumer, starting with product consistency and ensuring that the brand promise made to those consumers is met each and every time. HEXO's Original Stash bed has captured the value customer segment and helped the industry continue to take share from the black market. HEXO's recent announcement to acquire 48North provides a portfolio of brands, spanning from high-quality products for passionate everyday cannabis users to innovative categories such as topicals, bath and intimacy products. And we look forward to adding Redecan's incredibly popular pre-rolls, among others, to HEXO's extensive and growing brand and product portfolio. 
Sustainable margins in this industry are achieved by doing something cost effectively, something better or something different. We are winning on all streams. Our combined company has best-in-class growing and packaging costs, a reputation for consistent high-quality products. And I point to Redecan's pre-rolls and HEXO's beverages are 2 examples of many where we are lapping competition by doing something different and establishing our brands early and sustainably in the minds of consumers. 
Lastly, we will continue to lead the way on the innovation front with our state-of-the-art vape filling technology, and we'll soon be bringing our unique gummy production capabilities online. Combining our platform with HEXO will allow us to take full advantage of these capabilities and many more by combining our technological knowhow and through a scaled platform at their Belleville Center of Excellence. We expect to be able to continue growing the company's combined share of the Cannabis 2.0 market. 
Together, we are the #1 adult-use Canadian LP, and Sebastien has articulated our desire to accelerate our mutual growth trajectory into the U.S. legal market and Europe. I'm excited to be a part of the team as we continue to build this company. 
With that, I'll pass it back to you, Sebastien.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Pete, and welcome to the team. It's been a busy couple of weeks for HEXO. While this call is on the Redecan acquisition, I'd be remiss if I passed up the opportunity to discuss some of the other exciting events we've announced over the past 2 weeks, all of which further strengthened our Canadian platform and prepare the company for international growth.
Last week, we announced the acquisition of our first U.S. production facility in Colorado. This is going to be a foundational piece, Powered by HEXO strategy in the United States. We see plenty of opportunity across product categories to infuse CBD and other legal terpenes to improve the customer experience. I'm happy to say that the leaf isn't unique to me. Some of the largest CPG companies in the world agree with us. With solid early traction, we believe that Powered by HEXO will become the preeminent solution for leading CPG companies to safely enter the cannabinoid market. 
Combining HEXO's experience in cannabis with CPG partners' expertise in their individual end product categories to co-develop best-in-class cannabinoid-infused products. We've already start announcing some of our CPG partners. On the beverage side, we expanded our trust beverage copartnership with Molson Coors to create trust CBD USA, to bring hemp-derived CBD beverages to Colorado. This facility will provide us with the necessary infrastructure to begin production and enable the company to continue expanding our JV to create trust CBD-infused beverages while also creating the necessary capacity to support future non-beverage CPG partnerships. We look forward to announcing further partnerships in other CPG verticals as they're finalized. 
We also announced the acquisition of 48North on May 17. 48North is a brand-led, consumer-centric LP with an expansive portfolio of high-quality, accessibly priced products available across Canada. The company serves the Canadian markets with its brand portfolio that includes 48North, an innovative and high-quality cannabis brand, focused on thoughtfully crafted everyday staples for passionate cannabis users; Trail Mix, and excessively priced brand formulated with taste and aroma-first flavor profiles; and Latitude, a next-generation lifestyle platform in premium natural cannabis collection focused on wellness, beauty and beyond. We expect to leverage the team's experience to continue to build our Powered by HEXO strategy, expanding deeper into the beauty and wellness categories. This is an exciting time for HEXO. We're very proud that post closing, a Canadian company will be #1 in Canada's recreational market, but this is just the start of the journey together. There's a lot of work ahead for us. 
Over the next several quarters, there's 3 primary goals. The first is to integrate and drive synergies from the acquisitions of Zenabis, Redecan and 48North to solidify and expand on our position as the #1 adult-use LP in Canada. Second, to achieve positive earnings per share and accelerate our cash flow generation to enable the company to begin to self-fund its growth. Thirdly, we wish to execute our U.S. and European strategy in a way that solidifies our brand in those markets without compromising the profitability of HEXO. 
I'd like to thank all our shareholders for their support, and I know we speak on behalf of our entire combined team when they say that we look forward to building this platform into a top 3 global cannabis products company. 
With that, happy to take your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your first question is from the line of Aaron Grey from Alliance Global.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Thomas Grey,  Alliance Global Partners, Research Division - MD & Head of Consumer Research    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the acquisition of Redecan. So the first question from me, I would just love to get your perspective. Obviously, you've had a couple of acquisitions as far as this year with Zenabis, 48North and now Redecan. So would love to think at least early on how you're thinking about the overall kind of brand portfolio, potential brand new offering over time. Obviously, the Canadian market is rather fragmented right now, but you always had a potential consolidation within the industry. So how you're thinking about your own brand architecture within that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Aaron, there's a lot of work to do on the whole brand portfolio. So we will certainly -- you'll see a lot of movement in market But what's for sure is we are keeping Redecan a whole. That brand is phenomenal. It has the #1 consumer loyalty in Canada. And so we'll continue to evaluate the portfolio. We -- one of the most important things we've acquired through this market share are provincial listings. And so it's critical for HEXO to maintain all those listings whatever we do with the brands. Over time, we do expect that there will be some amount of simplification for consumers to understand where we're headed. But what's critical is to maintain our momentum now as the market share leader.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your next question is from the line of Tamy Chen from BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tamy Chen,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          First, I was wondering if to the extent that you could elaborate a bit more on the financial performance of Redecan. I think the press release alluded to high gross margins that they are generating cash. If you can just elaborate a bit more on that? Would they be margin accretive for HEXO? If you can talk a bit about the revenue growth and the margins over time? How their cash generation profile has been?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Tamy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Go ahead. Go ahead, Trent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, we're going to -- we're going to stay away from hard numbers for the moment. Obviously, HEXO has done extensive DD. We're very confident. I mean, the team at Redecan, we believe, has one of the most profitable licensed producers in all of Canada. What -- but we are going through taking their private financials and going through a full audit process. So those will be released to market as part of a consolidated effort later on in the following months. So what we can share is that publicly available information that's available through various different third-party sources like headset that positions us as that 17% market share leader in the country. And so if you break that up, you'll at least get some top line numbers, and you can at least expect that margins are better than what is available at HEXO today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tamy Chen,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. And my last question, a follow-up, is, Sebastien, could you talk a bit about the integration overall because this is the third Canadian acquisition now in a pretty short period of time. So could you talk a bit about how you're going to -- what the plan is in place to integrate it, achieve the synergies that you talked whether there's any facility rationalization or anything like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Trent here, Tamy. So yes, absolutely. We have a world-class team in Protiviti that we've contracted on the Zenabis integration. We've carried on that engagement for 48North and for Redecan. So far, so good. It's been a great process on Zenabis. We are expecting to close, as everyone knows, on June 1. We are going to be starting heavy on the integration planning coming up here soon. 
And we believe right now that we're going to be set to have all of the synergies that we've been talking about realized over the first probably 3 quarters -- over our next 3 to 4 quarters, 3 quarters post close for each one. So we don't see any risks on that right now. And we're still obviously, as integration plan, looking at all the different facilities, cultivation, capacity, production capacity, we'll make those decisions as we go through that process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Madeleine Marie Stone,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - Associate    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's actually Madeleine Stone on for Rupesh. Congratulations on the transaction. So first, just to start out, on your M&A strategy from here, would you expect to pause at this point going forward? Or should we still expect an aggressive agenda?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Madeleine. The M&A is going to remain, I think, a part of HEXO's strategy until we're top 3 globally as a products company, but what gives me a lot of confidence is seeing the rapid growth that Redecan is generated. And that's combined with the rapid growth of really all our acquisitions but also HEXO. At Q2, we were the fastest-growing public LP with 94% growth year-over-year. And so we continue to perform very well from an organic perspective, and we're choosing our M&A targets very wisely, obviously, culminating here with Reign.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Madeleine Marie Stone,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - Associate    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just another quick one for me. So what are the key areas of focus on the ability to retain the market share that you've picked up through the acquisition?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, it's not just a question of retaining it. It's how do we expand it organically from where we are. So there's a number of things that really drive consumer demand right now, especially on flower. So it starts with organoleptic old factory. So how do you actually make the cannabis taste, smell, touch, fantastic. Then we move to concentration, but not just concentration and how much THC, but what is the quality of the high that we deliver. And along with that quality of high, what's very critical to be able to do then is to deliver fresh products or freshness and also newness. Consumers are very interested in seeing new products. 
So this is really where the strength of the portfolio shines, with a varied production capability, with experts from multiple different companies, including HEXO, Redecan and all the teams, all the combined teams. We're able to go to market with a much broader portfolio of what consumers want and also to be much quicker in the servicing of that, which is where we're gathering a lot of synergies, for example, out of leveraging our Belleville manufacturing Center of Excellence. So those are some of the areas on which we're focused for the moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your next question is from the line of John Zamparo from CIBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Zamparo,  CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Associate    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And I'd also like to echo my congrats on the deal. I wanted to follow up on the synergies question. I know you're not going to quote a number, but can you talk a bit about what did you plan to do here and how production shifts as a result of this deal? And I would think if Redecan has industry-leading margins and that's because of some proprietary technology, is there capacity to shift some of HEXO's production over to Redecan's facilities? And then conversely, if -- where does Belleville fit into this deal, the sum of Redecan's production then shift into Belleville? Just any additional color you can provide on how your production footprint changes as a result would be helpful?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Again, look, we're going to be doing that, making those decisions through the integration planning process. But I can tell you this, look, Belleville has a lot of capacity. We love the fact that Redecan has made the most out of its production facility as it stands today, and there's still a few things going on there. But we see growth coming mostly through Belleville in terms of productive capacity and throughput with -- in relation to current and existing product lines and future product lines. But the -- we're not saying a lot about the financial results for all the reasons that Seb just said. But we do believe that there are a lot of operational synergies that come from all 3 of the most recent M&A that we talked about. We put out in the market that it's at least $30 million. And we've talked about -- we have an IR deck if you haven't seen that. 
Look, they're a very profitable company. They've done very, very, very well for themselves. Redecan were extremely pleased with the margins and where they've been able to take themselves. Again, as Seb just talked about our sales growth, you can see in the deck that Redecan had a 169% growth in the first quarter year-over-year. I mean, there's a lot of growth. So we think there's a lot of synergistic value here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Zamparo,  CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Associate    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. And then one more, if I may. The presentation referenced enhanced ability to sell into Europe or at least internationally. Can you talk about that a bit more? Are there issues with EU GMP? And can you provide some color on potential demand for products where Redecan has its best share, in particular, pre-rolls, oils and soft gels?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, John. Yes. So the Redecan team has done a phenomenal job in 2.0. I mean they're #1 in pre-roll, oils and capsules in Ontario. They're #1 in those categories in B.C. They're -- and Alberta as well -- #3 number in Alberta in oil, capsules and vapes. So all that technology is really what we want to lever to build the global portfolio. What we've done with Zenabis and what's cool about putting that into the HEXO family, we have an narcotics license now fully issued to sell cannabis from Malta to the entire EU, and we've combined with that. We've obtained GACP certification at our Masson site. We're currently undergoing GMP certification at Belleville, and we have GMP certification in Atholville with Zenabis. 
So over time, what we're planning to do is take the entire portfolio, we'll take the most profitable products and the most popular products from across the entire 4 company portfolio, so the broader HEXO portfolio, we'll export those to Malta for the distribution into the medical market in Europe. But perhaps more importantly, what I'm looking forward to is taking that IP and setting it up in not only in Colorado but soon in other states where legalization allows in the U.S. to take our portfolio to the United States.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your next question is from the line of Graeme Kreindler from Eight Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graeme Kreindler,  Eight Capital, Research Division - Principal    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe just a follow-up to the last question about the international market opportunity, whether that's Europe, the U.S. or otherwise. Sebastien, at the top of the call, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how you want to continue to build out that presence without compromising profitability. And you just mentioned the ability to port over IP, which is much more of a capital-light model. 
But I'm wondering, in addition to that, without compromising profitability, is part of that strategy going to be M&A to acquire maybe productive brands or other facilities or assets rather than big greenfield infrastructure? I'm just wondering how the potential opportunities that winds up with maintaining that positive EPS goal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Graeme. Well, I think just on its own, Canada is tremendously exciting market, right? We're $3 billion at retail right now, going to $8 billion very soon. So just by maintaining our 17% market share, you can see how there's huge accretion to HEXO shareholders. What we want to do is take all the lessons we've learned in Canada -- and in Canada, we've been amongst the majors. We've been 1 of the most responsible deployers of capital. So if you look at the HEXO-Redecan deployment capital, relative to other major cannabis companies, we're up to 4x more efficient on a market share to dollar invested basis, which means we've been great stewards of capital compared to all the major cannabis companies in Canada. 
With that in mind, though, we can get a lot better. So we've shifted the model as we go into the U.S. So instead of building greenfield production, as you say, the model is really to lever our intellectual property and we started to do that now in Colorado with Molson Coors where we're to do it again with the facility that we're building in Colorado, which is much leaner, much smaller than our Belleville facility, but really focused on providing that powered by active ingredient to our CPG partners. And what's exciting about the partnerships is that they have in the U.S. the infrastructure to go to market. 
We don't need to build it again. In Canada, we needed to spend -- we spent about $160 million building the best and largest beverage facility in the world for cannabis. In the U.S., regulations allow us to actually lever existing Molson assets and other third-party manufacturing assets. So we can take the Powered by HEXO IP or the syrup that we manufacture in Colorado that's manufactured from hemp, so it's fully legal, and go to those legal states where there are manufacturing centers with our CPG partners and have them bring that to market. So it should be meaningfully more light in terms of capital deployment and be highly accretive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graeme Kreindler,  Eight Capital, Research Division - Principal    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Understood. And then a question regarding the combined brand and product portfolio, that's really covering the spectrum across form factor, use cases and consumer segments. You talked -- you mentioned before about having some simplification over time on that. But I'm wondering, are there any areas specifically where HEXO is still looking to fill in or invest at that point -- sorry, at this point in terms of maybe a specific area of the market, use case or consumer segment where it feels like it might be a little bit lighter relative to the rest of the portfolio at this time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. What's critical for us is really to make sure, again, that we not only hold that market share but grow organically. And what we've seen now is that the major product categories in cannabis, so flower, pre-roll, vape are must wins. Now what we've had quite a bit of success with has been winning in some niche categories. So when you start to look at hash and beverage, but still very meaningful categories. I mean they can be up to, say, 7% of the market on their own -- those particular categories. So critical to stay #1 there. 
The real gem with Redecan now is that we've got dominance in pre-roll between the portfolio of companies. And we expect that pre-roll will become a huge part of the total demand. So whether that's 20%, 25% of total cannabis demand over time, once we get pre-rolls to strain specific, same price as flower across the whole product portfolio, I believe that the ease and convenience of shopping, the quality products at a great price, will really drive demand. Flower is not going away anytime soon, and that's why it's important that we invest in high-quality production. Our Atholville site with Zenabis, obviously, the huge success and quality that reticent outputs, and of course, smaller craft brands, like 48North, combined with HEXO's ability to produce that flower for some of the lowest price in the country gives us a really nice opportunity to keep playing not only in value with products like our Original Stash and bake sales but also to premiumize the portfolio between 48North, Redecan and up. 
And so those are some of the areas of focus, overall, critical to maintain leadership in the spaces like beverage, where we currently hold a 44% market share. And we want to reproduce that #1 feeling in terms of market share. So anytime we can pick up from that 20 share type towards 40, we'll take that opportunity in the major categories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Andrew Carter,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate VP    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          First thing I wanted to ask, I know you mentioned it during the commentary that Redecan engaged in other options. So I guess the first thing I'd be interested in is that there were other license producers involved? And kind of to that in, I know the press release noted that the termination fees if this breaks under any circumstances. Could there be a risk another acquirer comes in over the top here? Or is this agreement set in stone at this point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The agreement -- no, the agreement is very strong. I think the -- we can certainly ask the Redecan cofounders here. They've had their choice of dance partners. I mean, I think we've talked about Redecan being one of the worst kept secrets and sort of within industry circles. I think any other license producer would have gained a lot of value by doing a deal with Redecan, but what's important here is that Redecan gains a lot of value by partnering with the right partner. Pete, I'm not sure if you'd like to say a few words about HEXO and your commitment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pete Montour,   -     [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, I love to. Thank you, Sebastien. Redecan operated as a lean private company for years. We have significant success in the Canadian market so far. It really made the most sense to find a complementary partner that already had significant infrastructure built out that would help us move to the next stage of growth for the Redecan brand. Well, Redecan can dominate certain markets in Canada, our partnership with HEXO brings another level of sophistication to the business. And we recognize what HEXO can bring to the table.
Some points to that would be HEXO Center of Excellence in Belleville and overall substantial national infrastructure that has been built. HEXO's existing market leadership in a number of different markets where Redecan has little-to-no presence and the opportunity to leverage the Powered by HEXO platform with it brings market knowledge, technology, IP development, distribution expertise, the existing partnerships with leading CPG companies and international opportunities, particularly expansion into the largest market in the world, the U.S.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Andrew Carter,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate VP    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sounds good. I appreciate that. Thinking of that, I want to mention the pre-roll you've mentioned it and we've seen that in the deck. The Redecan market share pre-rolls has been pretty much uninterrupted in the leadership. They are not disrupted. I know that's a really -- it seems like it solves some of the mousetraps that other producers are looking for in terms of automatization, quality consistency. I guess could you speak to that? 
And then the second, you mentioned kind of going into the U.S. Would you consider kind of leveraging that proprietary technology for the U.S. and maybe doing something with the current operators, any way to utilize that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So it's a couple of -- so yes and yes quickly, but -- so the first part, and I think that was one of the huge value adds that HEXO can immediately add from a synergy perspective on the revenue line to Redecan. We are going to take that pre-roll technology that Redecan has perfected and that we're going to scale it. And a lot of that is part about having that immediately the license space available. And what we have in Belleville is just that. So we're able to unlock the potential there, and really go full national with that phenomenal pre-roll product, which is the Redees. We have a number of special IP around pre-rolls where we think we're actually going to be able to enhance the combined experience. So look forward to talking about -- more about that soon. 
More importantly, I think, is the U.S. opportunity. HEXO and Redecan intend to become the pre-roll provider for all of the U.S. as soon as federal legalization allow. So that's part of what we're working on right now. We're not going to go into that market until we have legal clarity, but we are certainly setting up and investing ahead of that market. And we're confident that between Redecan's knowhow and HEXO's IP lead -- remind you that HEXO has the second largest IP portfolio in Canada today. It's even bigger now with Redecan joining, but we're going to formalize all that IP, and we believe we really have something wonderful to go to the U.S., go to eventually MSOs, but also mass channel when available and significantly lower current cost of goods for the MSOs, deliver them better margins and better product and really create a win-win-win. And that's where Powered by HEXO really shines in our focus to be a products company and not competing over the MSOs to be phenomenal retail companies.

          Your next question is from the line of Pablo Zuanic from Cantor Fitzgerald.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pablo Ernesto Zuanic,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Can I just go back to the previous question, back to -- for Pete, I guess asking in a different way, why was this the right time to do this deal, not a year from now or maybe 6 months ago? And can I repeat the question, is there a termination fee? I don't know if that was disclosed or not. And then I have -- and I guess a separate one for you, Sebastien. You did mention the U.S. Some people believe that Canopy Growth has built a beachhead through its contingent deal structure with Acreage Holdings. Is that something that you would consider given that you have all these assets now in the portfolio and IP that you've talked about? Or is it just like you said, just going to wait until it's legal -- fairly -- there's clarity on the federal side before doing anything. It seems like the contingent approach may be working for Canopy and they maybe getting credit for it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Pablo. So let me take that question about just the Canopy structure, and then I'll turn it over to Trent just to talk about break fees and where we are in the setup. But -- so I think from the start, Canopy has a different strategy than HEXO. HEXO is not a retail company. And so you will very unlikely see us make a move to option or buy a multistate operator. Our model, however -- I think you're correctly assessing. Our portfolio is incredibly strong, and Canopy doesn't scare us. I mean, to be fair, they were 2 years in market in Canada ahead of us. They were 6 months ahead of us on beverage. We've killed them in beverage. We're 44 share of market now to their 22. We've beat them overall now. We're #1 in adult-use share in a key market that they've been chasing, and they've outspent us for that market share 4:1. 
So for every 10 basis points of market share that they've -- if you look at the total capital deployed, Canopy spent north of $80 million and HEXO-Redecan are sub-$20 million. So we've been remarkably capital efficient. So I'm really not worried about competing with them in the U.S. The reason we're able to do that is because we chose a differentiated strategy. We're going to be the best products company. And so yes, we're going to manufacture the products where it's pre-rolls, cash. We already make our beverages. We're going to add functional food products with other CPG partners very quickly. 
So the idea is to build this winning portfolio, and when regulations allow, we can take that portfolio into mass channel. So for example, our CBD beverages are available today in liquor stores in Colorado, but also hopefully, on the shelves of MSOs where we can go and increase the MSOs margins, increase the quality of the product offering that's available to consumers and then, of course, make meaningful revenue for HEXO positioning us in that top 3 global cannabis products company from a market share perspective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thank you. So look, a couple of things I'll add there and answer to your question as well. We aren't going to be Acreage. We're not trying to be that Canopy-Acreage thing. But I can tell you that, though, we are actively engaging our legal counsel on the U.S. side to look at what structures we can obtain to be able to break into the U.S. market sooner than later. I can't promise anything, but we are actively looking to gain a structure that we can get into the U.S. market and participate and have that be accretive to our shareholders. But we'll keep people updated on that. 
In relation to the Redecan and the break fee -- we do break yes, there's going to be a fee. It's not punitive. But yes, I think traditionally, you'd see that. And we would have to cover a lot of their expenses, and there is going to be a break fee. We don't anticipate that happening in a private transaction, but yes. 
The other thing I would add, you asked about the timing, and I don't want to speak for Pete and Redecan, but being actively involved from the very beginning, I can tell you that, look, Redecan is -- has the same issue that we had with regards to Masson in our cultivation. We know we're running up against capacity. On their production facility, they're running up against capacity And we -- and Pete said it earlier, there are complementary markets geographically that both of us tend to dominate, and we can really complement each other. 
And so this is a great time as the industry starts to consolidate, to do something meaningful in a meaningful way, and I said it before, a (inaudible) merged, they became #1 into their credit, but it was a gap. It was a gap to everybody else, and we wanted to make that up. Redecan was at the same mindset. And here we find ourselves, now #1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pablo Ernesto Zuanic,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Congrats. And just if I can ask Pete directly 1 question. Obviously, great performance in pre-rolls, right, significant market share and leadership. But how do you compare your pre-roll performance with, say, your performance in flower and vapes, and if they are different, why? That's it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pete Montour,   -     [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, pre-roll is something we knew we could differentiate ourselves from everybody, right off the bat. We put a lot of focus into that moving forward. We've always tried to still maintain other markets, the flower and the vape as well as we've come along, again, with our focus moving into the pre-roll and a couple of the other sectors that we are dominating or doing well in. So with the partnership now, I guess we get a chance to look at everything as a whole and see what we can do better on all firms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Bottomley,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just wanted to take a further step back here when we speak about market share and branding. And maybe this isn't even specific to HEXO or Redecan or any other of your brand in your portfolio. But just at a more holistic level, when I chat with a lot of retailers, some of the public, some of them private with respect to the actual boots on the ground experience, it seems that this sector is still really determined with respect to market share about what products are new, what the pricing point seemed to be the most important and the overall level of consumer awareness still seems to be a bit limited. 
So just wondering if you could give any commentary on -- particularly on the Redecan side of what the success factors have been to date and how this will represent longer-term opportunity of market share as opposed to something that happens to be doing well today in a very fast-changing market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Matt. Well, I think where Redecan has really had a ton of success has been a story of focus. So they've really focused on the Ontario market for which I commend them and that's why they position themselves as #1 and in a number of 2.0 categories as well. The second part of their strategy that I loved was the operational focus. So really lean, highly automated, focused on what matters in terms of throughput and quality. And when I look and I compare that strategy to HEXO's strategy, I think this is why we get along, HEXO has been focused on operating efficiencies for the last 8 years. We are one of, if not the lowest cost producer in the country today. And that we've also put a significant amount of emphasis on our Belleville upscaling and manufacturing. 
The other piece that we did from a strategic perspective, we focused on Quebec. So we focused on a single market, and we built up HEXO as a dominant brand in that market. So I think by following those strategies -- and we were both focused on the adult-use market, by the way, so another thing that was very similar in the way we thought. So I think that approach is why we -- each of our respective companies have been so successful. And I think that continued approach together now with a dominant position with the moat around listings, because as you may know, it's a lot harder to get new listings now, but the portfolio -- HEXO's portfolio now, we've got plenty of listings across the country. And so -- well, in fact, it has as you know and as we pointed out on the call many times, the #1 amount of listings and market share.
So that is incredibly an incredibly strong moat around our business on top of an underlying strategy that's been successful now for many years, for both HEXO and Redecan. So I don't think that's going to slow down. There's a reason Redecan was up year-over-year or more than 100%, almost 170%. There's a reason HEXO year-over-year was up 100%. It was the fastest-growing license producer. So it's not like we're taking companies and saying, we're going to merge these companies that don't know how to grow. We're merging these companies that are the fastest-growing companies in the entire industry. And so we have demand for our products. We're not worried about that at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Bottomley,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Very helpful. And just one other question. Just going back to some of the other commentary and questions on this call for the integration side of things. So one of your peers, several years ago, was kind of seen as the big aggregator in this space by M&A and both of that, if not all of it has sort of fallen by the wayside. So that strategy seems more to invest into parallels and things that were part of the business. But I'm just wondering if you could give any sort of lessons learned or reasons why this sort of aggressive strategy of rolling up a lot of brands and companies that you believe to have the longevity in the space is different than sort of what we've seen in the past and this is the space that has proved to some investors?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trent MacDonald,  HEXO Corp. - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Let me take that one. Let me start by saying it's a new world. At the time that you're talking about, it was a new industry. People weren't prepared. They didn't have the right team. They didn't have the right infrastructure, the right process to do what they tried to do at that time. We're much more mature industry. We are a much more mature company. And we have the right players at the table to make this happen. So my background is in retail. I just came out of a major consolidator in neighborly pharmacy who was deemed best -- the largest growing company last year with Globe Mail. We have people in operations who come from MERS and LG. We have like -- a long-standing CEO in the entire space, and that's just a few in the experience. And we've done it right. We've taken on Protiviti. And I don't want to keep plugging Protiviti all the time, but they are world-class consulting company, over $1 billion in top line. They have an amazing team on the M&A, integration planning and integration execution side. It's just a very, very different world.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I also want to add to that, Matt, that look at the strategy. So really take the time to understand HEXO's strategy. It's completely different than what we saw out of that other player. That other player bought everything under the sun. They said, we have market cap, let's go buy everything that even looks like cannabis. HEXO is very different. We're very focused. We're focused on adult-use share. We're only buying companies that have class-leading cost structure, right? So yes, maybe the balance sheet was upside down on Zenabis, for example, but we fixed that. That was a balance sheet problem. It was not an income statement problem. So we're buying companies that can generate and that are immediately accretive. 
Look at how much we're paying for these acquisitions. We're not overpaying. We're paying fair multiples that are almost -- that are almost exclusively immediately accretive in a big way. And we're buying brands that resonate in the adult-use market. We're not confused about whether we want to be medical or whether we're going to buy something that has this historical significance, that's not what we're buying. We're buying brands that work and that resonate with consumers. 
And those other players back in the day, I may add, because I went head-to-head, and we were often told back when we were the underdog, "Listen, those companies are -- have this amazing cost of capital advantage and looking at them go." Well, cost of capital is meaningless if you can't produce high-quality product at a great price. And this is what HEXO has proven organically even before we started doing M&A. This is something Redecan has proven organically before their first M&A deal. And so now, we're combining those management teams, and now we have a capital advantage. So not only have we made it to #1 but the only advantage those guys had before, they no longer have. So we've always had the lowest cost. We've always had some of the best quality products and a very focused strategy. Now we're adding to that leadership, which gives us that huge moat. So watch us go.

          Your next question is from the line of John Chu from ester Des Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chu,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          One question for Sebastien and one for Pete. Sebastien, just on the M&A strategy. You talked about international M&A going forward, but are you done on the domestic side? And the reason why I'm asking is when I look at your portfolio, the one void I do see in that portfolio is on the high-end premium or what we'll call it even super premium side, and I'm just curious if that's an area you're looking to address.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, I'd love to challenge that, John. I mean, I disagree with you. I'd say Redecan has some of the best product in the country, HEXO up and our Original Stash reserve, again, some of the best. If you're referring to premium in terms of like some smaller growers that are going and just pricing out a market because they can't grow at cost. I think that's a dying breed. 
We are not going to go buy a small craft growers and try to scale them. So the quality craft growers are out there, they do exist. I think they're going to take up 20% to 30% of the total market eventually between the specialists and the craft growers. But one of the big mistakes, as you go buy what makes a small craft grower grade, you try to scale that and you lose it. You need the individual tearing attention for the ultra-premium craft, and that's okay. And I think there's a great position out there in market for those companies. That's not what HEXO Redecan are trying to be. We are trying to be the most relevant brand to 85% of consumers. And so by doing that, means, yes, absolute high quality, but manufactured at scale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chu,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Perfect. And then, Pete, I think Trent mentioned earlier that one of the reasons why you're looking at the timing of the transaction was you're starting to get hindered by your own capacity restrictions and whatnot. Can you maybe just talk a bit about that and just really the operational footprint, what's your cultivation capacity in kilograms per year? The facility, is it indoor or greenhouse? Is it EU GMP, and do you have like extraction capabilities and whatnot, just maybe just talk about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pete Montour,   -     [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, a lot of the information facility-wise is pretty readily available out there. Just touching on the timing, it was only something when you would consider with the right partner? And we knew we had to make the next move in growth and infrastructure. We explored a lot of options and avenues to try and do it internally. But when the right partner came along, that was our best fit. Is there anything else you guys can add into the mix with that if that statement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think, John, we're really adding -- I mean, there's hybrid, so custom-built hybrid greenhouse is the primary grower for Redecan, but also the only successful outdoor grow I've seen. So a real opportunity for us to continue lower our cost. So I did mention as HEXO being about what we believe is the lowest cost producer in the country with the exclusion of Redecan's outdoor growth. So I do think that gives us an opportunity on extract and where to go. 
And the team there is phenomenal. Like, you'll see that video we put out this morning, introducing it. You could see a video an overview of Redecan City. So you'll see all the hoop houses. The -- so the technology and the care that the Redecan team has put to their outdoor grow has simply -- has been one of the best I've seen in the whole country. So a huge opportunity there. And really, this now, it's not about scaling cultivation. So much -- like, if you look at the total HEXO-Redecan portfolio, we likely have too many kilograms. So we're going to work that through integration. 
And HEXO has experience there. I mean we were the first company to rightsize, go to SKU-by-SKU planning to market. And so we have a great SS and OP process and team. So we're going to do that again here. I think the scale-up in terms of capacity was licensed manufacturing space. And this is the strategic bet that HEXO made a few years ago with our Belleville Center of Excellence that has truly unlocked that ahead of the 2.0 need. 
So we made the investment, and these are multiyear investments, right, because when you talk about standing up a multi-hundred million dollar facility, which is Belleville, I mean you're talking about 1 million square feet of advanced manufacturing, that takes a lot of years to set up. We have it today. So now it's simply a question of taking the best practices at Redecan, things that HEXO hasn't invested yet, like automated robots for vape filling, for example, scaling that into Belleville, taking the specific unique pre-roll technology, scaling that up again to Belleville, taking the gummy lines that are currently operational at Redecan doing the same. So it's giving us a lot of space for us to do that on the 2.0 side, I think.

          Your last question is from the line of Doug Miehm from RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Miehm,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Geez, we've all been wondering for years who would end up with Redecan or if they would ultimately become consolidators themselves, but it's great to see this deal done. My question has to do with the defensibility of the #1 status in Redecan right now in terms of pre-rolls and number of other things as well. And initially, this is probably a function of IP and technology and capability. And I'm wondering if that is morphed into more a brand moat now? Because I want to understand how defensible your pre-roll position is. And then secondly, what I'm curious about is it appears that you're about to launch gummies with some technological capabilities as well. Maybe you could expand on that also.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks very much, Doug. So pre-roll capability is not a brand. I mean it's brands per sure, it's part of the moat; but this is a technology advantage, far, far and true and above. So the team at Redecan has applied 30 years of tobacco manufacturing experience and which on its own isn't enough. And then they combine that with some really smart cannabis engineering to produce the Redees products from -- and I've been all over the world looking at this pre-roll technology. Redecan is by far and above the best pre-roll technology that I've seen in the world. And HEXO, by the way, is no slouch. We have some of the best engineering teams in cannabis in the world. 
We've been trying to figure out pre-roll for years now. And I can say, although we're quite advanced and we're quite good at the pre-rolls we make, we are nowhere near Redecan. I mean, they've got a multiple year lead. And so there's a huge technology lead. We plan on cementing that from an IP perspective, so leveraging HEXO's expertise in IP protection to take what our trade secrets and actually patent and protect around it. And then ultimately, in the next 3 to 5 years, I'm sure large tobacco companies will figure out how to apply their current cigarette manufacturing technology to cannabis. But that's a 3- to 5-year lead where, to your point, we need to go build that brand moat, which is why we're investing in the U.S., which is why we want to put this pre-roll technology into the U.S. to build brand there to get ahead of that technology moat starting to falter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sebastien G. St-Louis,  HEXO Corp. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. The gummy -- well, the gummy line -- it's a gorgeous line that Redecan put together a phenomenal tasting product. And so that moat is more about speed to market, but there's a couple of tricks that we are using that are giving -- so I wouldn't say it's the same level of technology moat than the pre-rolls but certainly some knowhow and manufacturing expertise. And that's a product that we are very much looking forward to -- combine into our discussions with our CPG partners because that is an area of interest for functional foods, of course, not just in Canada but internationally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Team, if you'll indulge me for 2 minutes, I want to celebrate with you. Eight years ago, we started this business -- I started this business, and we said we're going to be a major player in the medical cannabis market. Then legalization came about, and we just saw an opportunity and we said, "We have to focus. We won't abandon those patients. We still have many of them today, but we are going to focus on becoming an adult-use brand leader." We set a 3-stage pillar essentially to achieve that. And we said that brand would be key. The first part of brand would be distribution and market share. So we needed to be top 3. And so we committed years ago to be top 3 in Canada. We committed as well to build an IP portfolio that would have put a moat around the business to eventually build that brand, and we committed to doing so with some of the industry's best margins because we said at no point being #3, #2 or #1, if you're not highly profitable. 
Well, today, it's a really historic moment for myself, for the HEXO team, for the Redecan team, which I'm really proud to welcome to our family because we have become the #1 Canadian player in adult-use rec share. It's a monumental achievement. Our IP portfolio is now amongst the best, top 2 for sure, and continues to expand and gives us tons of opportunity to get stronger with Redecan. And from a profitability perspective, we are bringing in to HEXO, which was already had the largest -- the best gross margins in the adult-use business, we're bringing a player that is one of the most profitable LPs on its own. And I really do look forward to getting through the audit, so we can share the numbers and get everyone excited around that. 
So a big thanks to the whole HEXO team, a huge welcome to Redecan, and thank you so much. We look forward to our next conversation.

In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies 
may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety 
of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current 
expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ 
materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a 
number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically 
identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies 
may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or 
incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS,
OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS.
IN NO WAY DOES REFINITIV OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER
DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN
