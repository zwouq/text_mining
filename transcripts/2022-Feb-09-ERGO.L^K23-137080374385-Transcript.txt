Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Ergomed analyst call hosted by Executive Chairman, Miroslav Reljanovic; and Chief Financial Officer, Richard Barfield; and President of ADAMAS, Ian Montague. (Operator Instructions)
And now I'd like to hand over to Executive Chairman, Miroslav Reljanovic to open the presentation. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining our analyst presentation meeting. As you have seen earlier today in our -- or we announced the acquisition of ADAMAS from South England. We have bought the company and we are going to present with the deal, which has been -- which had been closed and announced now.
Next slide, please. Here are the presenters. Apart from myself, this is Richard Barfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Ian Montague, President of ADAMAS.
So next slide. Next slide. I would like to remind you on our vision of building up a company for the global leadership in specialized pharmaceutical services addressing unmet medical needs and patient safety. Unmet medical needs, particularly in the area of rare diseases and oncology. And patient safety, given the safety of the drugs and compliance model [mentioned] by ADAMAS acquisition.
So next slide. Here's the markets that we operate. CRO by global market was last year in the range of $42 billion with about 6%. While the area they are very specialized oncology and rare, which is about half of the market, has a significantly higher attractive growth of around 10%. So basically, we specialize in half of the market in oncology and where are the most common indication where a biotech and specialty pharma does develop.
In addition to [high growth of marker], we specialize in pharmacovigilance about safety market, which is a significant -- over $5 billions with fantastic growth of about 16% per annum. And the new market where we enter now and which is quite connected, particularly pharmacovigilance, this -- all these income plus market, which is about [$1.7] billion. Our market now is going to grow like a pharmacovigilance 16%. So we believe that the ADAMAS is a platform for further growth and potential acquisitions we could get a very realistic having the lead position to market [par regions].
Next one, here are some key strategic elements why we decided for acquiring a bidding for ADAMAS and settling in that transaction. There is always a complementary specialism in regulatory compliance and quality assurance with our current business in the area of drug development and the pharmacovigilance.
I just want to stress that within our organization, we have obviously quality assurance teams [on the question of] will serve basically, mostly for our [regional], bank regions and drug development that we have.
In ADAMAS, we are getting there. We are basically scaling up and offering these services to the market as a standalone, very sophisticated service offering. Ito obviously strengthened position for Ergomed as a focused specialized pharmaceutical provider. And expand our US but also Europe and Africa presence, which is also important and part of our strategy [out].
ADAMAS will continue as an independent business with specialist focus. We can -- we will present further couple slides about that. And obviously, we are getting with ADAMAS broader service offering and platform for growth, particularly in a very sophisticated area of services in pharma business related to compliance and [all idea]. ADAMAS currently has about 100 clients, which is really big number. And we think that client base is how we put some synergies, as well as other [most friends] involved. You need [75] years of experience with the 700 clients and the 40 out of 50 big pharma, which is pretty impressive and what is also important for our shareholders [second market that]. This acquisition will be immediately earnings accretive, which is kind of [approaching] the excess of acquisitions, as you know.
Next one. I would like to ask my colleague, Ian, he's the President of ADAMAS to basically talk about next couple of slides about ADAMAS as a company. Yes, Ian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Miro. And hi, my name is Ian Montague and President of ADAMAS. I joined the company eight years ago as Chief Operating Officer and then Chief Executive Officer, and now President. The company was founded 25 years ago.
So we've got really strong provenance in our market. And we've got a reputation for delivering gold standard services and an outstanding reputation. In fact, quite bulletproof, our whole culture is built on service excellence and delivering great services to our clients. And that's why over the 25 years that we've been trading, we work with 700 pharma or biotech companies, and we're currently working with the 40 out of the top 50 pharma biotechs. And we have an absolutely tremendous retention of our clients as well. And many of our clients have been with us for sort of 10 years or more.
And in fact, since the company was founded, the other aspects of ADAMAS that I think is really important for our company and our sector and we're quite unique in this is that we have a genuinely global coverage. We have physical offices in both Mumbai, London, and on the East Coast of the US, and recently two years ago, I relocated to West Coast of the US to open our offices in San Diego. So we have a genuinely global presence and a really, really powerful reputation in our sector.
Next slide, please.
So this slide was fairly complicated. But really what it outlined is that all pharma companies and biotech companies are operating clinical development programs. You look [along with SOP], we've got various phases of clinical development. And then down the side for each of those sectors, you have fairly sort of rigorous regulation.
So for example, you've got good clinical practice, GCP; good pharmacovigilance practice, which tends to be when products have actually reached the market and are being marketed; and you have signal detection to recognize that there are not very extensive side effects with the products. So from preclinical all the way through to pharmacovigilance, client -- as our clients who have multiple -- usually multiple clinical development programs going and very often multiple products, the important thing with ADAMAS is that we offer the full spectrum of services.
We're a full-service provider. And for our clients, that's really important because there is nothing more inconvenient than pitching out, looking for some sort of pharmacovigilance auditing and then realizing that there's good clinical practice needed as well. And then you have to go to a different provider. And over the years, we've developed the expertise in all of the GXPs [back hold] across all the phases of clinical development and that really does put us in a very, very strong position in our sector.
Next slide, please. So I think it's no secret that the normal pharma industry is one of the most heavily regulated and to the point that our clients may have several products under development. And we play an absolutely mission-critical role in providing quality assurance services and assuring that basically the clients that are investing millions indeed, sometimes billions of pounds in developing a product, all compliant with regulatory requirements, whether it's the FDA, the MHRA, the EMA in Europe that have -- that compliant with those regulations and that there are no surprises.
Because the implications of not being compliant of the sort of soft end of the spectrum or perhaps the lack of data integrity and then weak clinical data is provided, which underlines the value of the products, or worst, still non-compliant shipping point patient safety, which can later lead to a clinical trial being completely suspended and the implication to the profits for a pharma company or biotech company events.
But at that stage, a very significant and ADAMAS played a critical role in making sure that those products reach the market and that the regulation authorities to undertake any kind of an audit of the company that they are ready for that and indeed compliant.
And next slide. I'm handing back there to Miro.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you, In. So, in here is a slide on our integration planning in Ergomed. We have Ian Montague as President of ADAMAS. As we stated before, as well as the entire management team of ADAMAS. So we will have a full continuity of the business, which is very important for the institution and in further growth of not being [all done around that gap].
So ADAMAS still continue as an independent specialist business retaining its very highly respected brands in the industry. And then the synergies, we see a really highly complementary services aligning, particularly PrimeVigilance audit-as-service and inspection preparation, particularly as a premium consulting offerings.
Management [was] involves such kind of activities. But having that now, ADAMAS is part of the group [the risk] that we've talking, I think we will be able to attack a much bigger opportunities than we managed to do before [because of track that doesn't have that yet].
Obviously, we are broadening our service offerings available to our Ergomed and PrimeVigilance customers. Immediately, we are adding additional technology services available to all clients because ADAMAS is developing technology associated with the auditing. And we will be going in more details about this technology at our annual results presentation, which is part of our technology initiative within Ergomed.
And as mentioned before, we strengthen further our geographic reach and all of that in Asia, also US, and [South India]. This is certainly a -- the ADAMAS is certain great platform for future growth into regulatory, assurance, and specialist pharma consulting services. But of course, in the name of regulatory compliance, which is absolutely critical in the business and fits [very well the other bigger] part of our business.
So next slide leads us to financials [page.] Richard?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Barfield,  Ergomed plc - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Miro. Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of slides on the financial highlights where the message is pretty simple and straightforward one. We're saying that this acquisition aligns with our financial objectives. And it very much reflects our disciplined and strategic approach to acquisitions.
You can see on the slide here that the ADAMAS business has a -- an attractive financial profile. Revenues increasing in 2021 by 31%. We're forecasting that through 2023, we'll see revenue growth exceeding 20% per annum. The business makes a gross margin on fee income of around 50%, which aligns well with our business and reflects the sort of levels of an overall gross margin leads that we've been making on service fee income.
The adjusted EBITDA in 2021 was EUR1.8 million. We see the forward-looking position on EBITDA margin as being over 20% consistently going forward. The business is also like Ergomed, has strong operating cash flow conversion. So in the year just finished 2021, we saw -- we've seen a cash flow conversion of over 8% of adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow.
And then finally, the strong order book, giving high visibility, again, very much aligned to Ergomed, reflected its way we run our business and with a high level of visibility into 2022 revenues.
Next slide, please. And as I mentioned a second ago, it reflects the disciplined and strategic approach that we take to acquisitions. We're paying EUR25.6 million cash. It's all paid cash at completion. There is no deferred consideration.
The ADAMAS business will bring EUR1.4 million cans with it. So our enterprise value is EUR24.2 million. That represents a 13.4 multiple of 2021 adjusted EBITDA. And forward looking, it's about 12 times over what we expect to achieve in 2022. The funding, as I mentioned, it's account transaction. We're using our own internally generated cash.
We have drawn down on our facilities, but we've done that in order to make sure that we continue to have a high level of cash in the bank on the balance sheet ready for other opportunities that may come up going forward.
So just to summarize, it's in line with our disciplined approach. It's a quality premium business. It's in a high growth market. The strategic fit is excellent. The financial profile of ADAMAS is strong. And it's an immediately earnings enhancing acquisition.
Next slide, please.
And let me just finish off just by referring you to the ADAMAS website with this logo information. If you go into our presentation, you click on the logo and that will take you straight into the ADAMAS website. So that completes what we need to say on the financial front. And I think we're now going to questions. Is that right, Miro?

Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, yes, yes.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks so much. (Operator Instructions)
Stefan Hamill, Numis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stefan Hamill,  Numis - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Morning, everyone. Congrats for the deal. Can you hear me okay?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stefan Hamill,  Numis - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Just a couple questions from me. Can you just talk about the split of ADAMAS as business across -- what are Ergomed divisions? Is there any overlap with your current offerings? Or is everything purely additive?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's -- hi, Stefan. Hi, [Mercy. Hey, Warren.] It's purely an opinion that were current offering. As I mentioned before, you know, we have these services, but they are very used for more and more of the most important element of social quality or in the organization that this is additive regarding the service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stefan Hamill,  Numis - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And just -- can you comment on this current growth across what is clinical. So I guess that's the CRO [business] of ADAMAS versus what we would look at PV and other any substitute of additional synergies you see from the PV division, or the synergies across the [piece] or cross-selling between those?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We expect particularly, synergies in cross-selling in PV [since]. As you know, we have more than 200 clients in PV, ADAMAS has about 100 cllients and the current [PVGMB] part of the business of ADAMAS is in the range of 40% of the current business and the project higher growth of that business going forward. We think that's a synergistic play, particularly in that area of the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stefan Hamill,  Numis - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I get it. Thank you. And then just to clarify, had ADAMAS -- it's a 25-year old history. Is that purely been built organically? Has there been any acquisitions along the way? Could you comment on the number of employees and where they're located. I'm particularly interested in Mumbai and how many employees you have there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We have our core employees in Dubai and India. Their growth has been entirely organic. There's been no acquisitions and it's been debt free as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stefan Hamill,  Numis - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The total number of employees in. But you know that there are also quite significant consultancy base. Could you comment on this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean, we've got a consultancy base of 40 consultants. We've got a spread across the US, so we've got consultants on the East and West Coast of the US, and as well as through -- throughout in Europe. So one of our big strength is our global coverage. So we genuinely do offer a pan global service to our clients. Does that answer your question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stefan Hamill,  Numis - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much, folks. Yes, that's really clear. Cheers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, thank you, Stefan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miles Dixon, Peel Hunt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miles Dixon,  Peel Hunt - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Miro, Richard, Ian. And this is a bit similar to your second question, really. I mean, it's about the age of the company, 25 years old yet still achieving 30% growth. Is there anything you can try about the technology inflection point that you may or may not experience during the pandemic that you now expect to drive the change in scale moving forward?
And then secondly, on your existing clients and customers and other instances in the past where you've handled customers or clients back and forth between one another. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean, the pandemic definitely implemented some technological changes. We've always been at the forefront of developing auditing services. And we've always offered sort of limited remote services. So when the pandemic hit, obviously reducing and restricting travel, we went to an almost entirely remote, [so] space somewhere in the region of 85% to 90% of all of our work went remote. And we're actually seeing that trend continuing. It educated the market. And the new methods we brought in of remote auditing, the technological software and the platforms that we're using to provide those services have proven to be robust and really well received by our clients. And so, we now continue at around those levels of remote offering.
So COVID, whilst it was initially a bit of a challenge has actually proven to be a real benefit. And as we also realize a greater profitability from the remote service offering and a greater efficiency. Does that answer that question, Miles?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miles Dixon,  Peel Hunt - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's brilliant. Thank you. And then just the other smaller second half was where they had passed over the customers and clients between the two organizations before? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think that has happened historically. And I think mainly because both companies offer slightly different service offerings. And also, I think from a both I can certainly speak to either myself or client retention is very high. So when we win a client, they tend to stay with us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miles Dixon,  Peel Hunt - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Ian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, you're welcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Herrmann, Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Herrmann,  Stifel - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on what looks like a very attractive deal. Three, if I may. Firstly, just wanted to understand from a financial reporting, because I think you talk about the splitting of the ADAMAS as revenues between the PV and the CRO businesses as it will report functionally. Just wondered if there was some guidance on that.
And secondly, just on the sales process and how did the deal come about?
And then finally, just maybe just following up a little bit Miles's question on the growth in 2021 if was that boosted by COVID? Or that just the kind of a good underlying kind of section about -- how was it -- COVID impacted the growth of the business? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Richard, would you address the first question? By the way, thank you, thank you, Max [for who are you].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Barfield,  Ergomed plc - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you, Miro. Morning, Max.
So just on the financial reporting, yes, the first part of question on the financial reporting. In 2021, the split, so if we think about how we're going to report it in terms of the revenue being split across, CRO and PV, in 2021, that was a 60/40 split. As both Ian and Miro have said, it's expected that there will be a higher level of growth in the PV side -- related side of the business. So we would see that 60/40 split trending down over time. And we've assumed of planning purposes that would be something like 4% coming off the CRO going onto the PV on an annual basis. So, by the time you get through to 2025, for example, you'd be down to something like a 44/56 split. So that's the trend that we see going forward with a higher level of -- slightly higher level of growth and even PV than in CRO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then the question is the numbers in 2021, Richard. Being triggered by pandemic, maybe you can address this question, Ian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean, I think initially, we saw a dip in revenues as a result of the COVID epidemic. I think, [line in] pandemic like many companies. And so we recovered from that very quickly. And I think the answer to your question is a combination of our natural growth and our move to remote services. And again, as I have already mentioned, that improved our profitability as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Ian. I would like to comment here Max as well that regarding revenue recognition -- revenue projections and recognition for 2022, we see a clear trend of growth. And also 2021 was really more [current] year of moving through remote monitoring, and so maybe remote auditing, and stuff like that, which is not in place and [make] the business more efficient with these technologies. And we are confident in the growth of that business going forward.
And the last question was the sales process. Richard, what do you mean by salespersons? Could you clarify what you're interested in
I guess it was ADAMAS business that you had seen [over] ADAMAS business had been looking for a potential trade buyer. It has how did the deal came about, how long and when did you first meet and those sorts of things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, okay. So we know ADAMAS obviously for many years. We are in very similar business of compliance with safety or auditing. So we know very well the business, we know very well about the [inflation] to business, and we've been talking with advisors for the last couple of years about ADAMAS being our target M&A process here. And then opportunity came a couple of months ago, where video was leading the process and we have been chosen by ADAMAS management and founders as the best fit for further development of the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Herrmann,  Stifel - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Max.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonas Peciulis, Edison.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonas Peciulis,  Edison - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good morning. Yes, congratulations for the transaction. I guess [the and] I have couple of many questions. Maybe on the revenue mix in terms of geographies, so after the acquisition -- ADAMAS acquisition a year ago, we saw a shift in the revenue mix in terms of the currencies and there was subsequent effects.
So obviously, we can't focus too much on forecasting for exchange. But just to be prepared, so how then revenues have changed in terms of currencies and geographies. If you can elaborate on that, I guess, if you could just provide us precise geography split when it comes to ADAMAS last year performance suggests that at least no qualitative description most came from the UK or the US for that space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Ian, could you -- I think could you address this question regarding the revenue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, yes, yes. Approximately, 60% of our revenues are generated from the US, with about 35% to 38% from Europe and then a small percentage from APAC. And we grow -- we're growing strongly in Europe, but the real growth is coming from the US. Particularly, we're seeing very good growth on the West Coast of the US.
We opened new offices in San Diego just about a year and a half ago. And we've recognized a really significant uptake in our new business on the West Coast. And we've caught of -- I think, to be frank, a critical mass on the East Coast where we're seeing strong growth as well. And I think that's a trend that will definitely continue. And I think for the future, the US is an area where we will continue to focus and invest our efforts. Does that answer your question (multiple speakers)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonas Peciulis,  Edison - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you. That's very helpful. Just to clarify, so in Europe and say in Europe, so just ratio, you're aware this was a single pound. Can you still elaborate that into detail?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not quite sure I understand the question --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonas Peciulis,  Edison - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess -- so, I guess in Europe, your existing revenues in euros and in pounds right. So when they come, you know the split, but that's a detail I guess will follow into.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Montague,  ADAMAS - President    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonas Peciulis,  Edison - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I can continue, I guess with my second question. So it's a practical one actually. So what level of additional financial detail are you going to release with the full year results? I would presume there will be no consolidation with the previous year result. But any chance for something about performance statements or is the current press release that's it so we can start working on other investment space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard, could you address it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Barfield,  Ergomed plc - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. With the annual report, which will be coming out in about six weeks' time, we will obviously have to treat this as a post-balance sheet event. We will do the normal disclosures required for a post-balance sheet event. So we'll have to give some level of information on the net assets acquired, the goodwill, the trading history of the company, and so on. But there won't be a lot of financial break down, which will really support you from the analytical perspective.
We've given some information on the call today about the split of revenues as we intend to report them across the two divisions. There's other information in the presentation about the level of gross margin and the level of growth.
And also, if you think about funding that we put in place, there will obviously be some financial cost associated with that. So I think there are a number of elements in the material that we've already provided, which would support the development model. But if you have more detail that you would like, then please feel free to follow up with me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonas Peciulis,  Edison - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. That's all from my side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. There's no further questions on the phones at the moment. But also just to let everybody know that the company will respond to the questions from the webcast after the call, okay. Thanks very much.
And now I hand it back to Miroslav Reljanovic for closing remarks. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miroslav Reljanovic,  Ergomed plc - Executive Chairman    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call and thank you for your questions, which will be addressed down. And we will be very open to receive any further questions that we can follow up after the call. So thank you very much and have a good day. And thank you, bye.

of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current 
expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ 
materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a 
number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically 
identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies 
may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or 
incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS,
OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS.
IN NO WAY DOES REFINITIV OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER
DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN
ANY EVENT TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S
CONFERENCE CALL ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE
MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.
