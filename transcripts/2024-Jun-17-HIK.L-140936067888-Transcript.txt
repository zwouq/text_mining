Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for joining this call. So, just a few words for introduction, you probably have read all of the announcement that we had put out for this latest acquisition. It's a modest acquisition in terms of the size relative to the group and relative to the injectables business.
But I'm very excited about it I think it's really adds a lot of strategic value and potential to the existing business that we have in the injectables. I think it's really exactly what we need as fuel to ensure our -- to maintain our high margins and ensure our growth in the coming years is bringing to us several different values in the products.
As you know, the deal will be -- will add the introduction of a commercialized products, including the Vanco Ready premix ready to use that vancomycin. In addition, we have a pipeline of 10 products primarily the RTU premixed bags, and they will be launched throughout the next five years or so.
From the manufacturing point of view, we'll have a huge facility with the big manufacturing technologies that we have there, including lyophilization, six lyos there, very equal and similar to the ones that we have here in Portugal.
In fact, they're exactly the same type, same manufacturer, same size. So transfers would be easy it will add the capacity that we have been building in Portugal, and this takes really usually a lot of time to build this type of capacity. This is something that we can get on hopefully in the two years, we should be operational, but it may be over two years, we'll see what depending on the delivery of some of the equipment that we're going to need.
And importantly, also an R&D center. This company will -- this deal will give us an R&D center that in Croatia in Zagreb, Croatia with the team, very competent team that we believe that not only from their competency is proven, they have developed a very interesting products, and their pipeline is really very, very interesting. So we're very excited to add this to our injectable -- strength injectables division strength.
You all know, we've been talking about those three things actually in the injectables. We've been talking about increasing our capacity so this is going to definitely do that. We've been talking about R&D that we wanted to really focus on R&D, try to get more value for less cost. And this is exactly what this is going to bring us.
And on top of it, I think specialty products in the pipeline and the commercialized products. We're getting very interesting unique products there that we can grow and we can enhance through the coming years. So excited about it, I think strategically it has exact fit to what we need and I think we can really do a lot with that.
This will also be something that will take away or decrease our capital investment that we already have for the injectables and it will take some of the spending that we were anticipating to spend the next five years and we'll invest them all in -- invest most of them in this site. Bill, do you want to add anything to this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, I think that's a good start, Riad. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [3]

Maybe we can open it to questions now.

Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions)
James Gordon, JP Morgan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Gordon, JPMorgan - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello. Can you hear me?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Gordon, JPMorgan - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. This is James with JP Morgan. A couple of questions, please. The first question was just so you're adding on a pro forma basis, $75 million of revenues. But I assume in terms of growth, we don't just grow those revenues.
We do some sort of effectively revenue synergies as you're going to have a faster growth in injectable base business. So can you quantify that at all? How quickly does that come through. How quickly are the top line synergies from the deal?
Second question would be on margins and EPS. So can you talk about how accretive this could be at the bottom line, medium term. So how much benefit that could be? And then finally, in terms of CapEx, so you're doing this two to three enhancement projects. So what would the incremental CapEx be from doing the deal? And how much is that reducing CapEx for the base of the company, if we think about it that way?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Let me start with the first question. So we did talk about this will bring in about $75 million in revenue. We did also say in the first 12 months, although we think this is with good margins is not as large as the margin that we already are operating the injectables division at.
So slightly less, but we believe that it's a matter of time before we realize all the synergies that we have and we start increasing the margins there, especially I think when we get to manufacture it ourselves. Right now, we will be manufacturing it through a contract manufacturer until we do the works that we're expecting to do at the site.
So today it is accretive it's got a good margins, but it's not as good as the current margins that came with the division. I don't think we did say it's neutral it's a very small $75 million in comparison to the $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion that the injectables overall, it's very small and effect will not be huge.
But I think as we grow it as we add products from the portfolio and as we start moving it into our own facilities, I think this will increase the margins and also the top line, I believe. As far as the CapEx, I would just say that today we have intentions in two things. We keep talking about it I think the two things that we've been focusing on with the injectables.
One is to grow our capacity, especially unique capacity with unique technology. Lyos have been really -- we've been utilising the huge capacity that we have and we've not we have a bigger demand than what we can use. So I think from the lyo capacity, this will be coming in really handy there.
Also, we'll be adding technologies, of course, like the premix filled and sterile environment, which is also very unique. There are not many companies that are able to do this very complicated process. This is something that Xellia had invested in, and I think we can use this one also not only for Vanco Ready and for the pipeline that we will be -- will have acquired. But also internally, we have few projects that we've been working on that required that technology.
I think the other part of it that we are also looking into that now with this adding capacity, some of the capacity that we're adding this year, we added last year and we continue to add to the injectables, we'll have plenty of capacity to do what we always wanted to do is do a contract manufacturing a part or division or subdivision of the injectables.
We've been very good at it. We have the right quality, we have the right plants, the technology. We have been doing well, as you know, have done remdesivir in a very short time and we do a lot of other ones, including biosimilars.
But we can't really take on a lot of potential customers or expand or contract manufacturing because of the capacity limitation that we have. So our own portfolio of core business is growing well. Also the contract manufacturing has potential to grow so we have to choose between which one do we focus on and we definitely want to focus in our core business.
So we're limiting how much new business of contract manufacturing we can take. I think with that added on in addition to the ones that we're working on and expanding the capacity, we will have an interesting contract manufacturing division which is something that I think will be very good, very lucrative and it would be great expansion to the growth that we have.
Bill, anything else you want to add to this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, I think you've said it well, Riad. So, I think maybe just the one thing just briefly on that, too is you mentioned on the margins overall, I think as we bring this as we endeavor to bring these products, both the R&D pipeline and the existing commercial products in house over the medium term, I think we'll see increased margins on those, as you mentioned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anybody else.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Cuddon, Deutsche Numis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Cuddon, Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much. I've got two questions, please. Obviously, you have some kind of history with this site. So I'd just be interested a bit of backstory as to kind of why now? Did you kind of have some sort of option kind of agreement on this size if it came available again?
And then secondly, for me, just with an eye on the potential kind of FTC, do you think you may have to sell some assets within the Xellia portfolio thinking specifically the vancomycin HCI? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. I'll take on the history and maybe Bill, if you take the FTC point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, the history of the size is very interesting. As you know, in 2014, we had acquired the BI assets in Bedford and that included the entire side, which had four sites at the time and an R&D center. And within that acquisition also, we had 114 products.
In fact, this is when I met Bill, Bill used to be the general manager of that at the time. So the negotiations what was between us and BI through myself and Bill, we sat opposite each other negotiating for many, many days.
But when we did acquire it, we realized two things. The first thing is that the site itself was, although two of the sites there were four factories, four manufacturing plants within that site, two of them were older and two of them were new brand new in fact.
One of them didn't even touch any products it was only water they were just installing the equipment at a time and some of the equipment were sort of boxes. So at that time, the facility was under consent decree. So it needed a lot of time to be, especially with the FDA from the regulatory side, t has to be -- there has to be some corrective actions to be done. There was some equipment that had to be installed, validation has to be done.
So there was a lot of complications to manufacture anything in that site. There were those still validations to be done and the consent decree didn't makes things easier. So what we elected to do is if we wanted to transfer the products that we acquired, we needed equipment because the product there was huge, 114 products. We elected to transfer about 80 of them and we did not have the capacity, especially the lyo capacity to transfer all of them.
So what we elected to do is to turn to tear one facility down. That was a newest facility, take all the equipment, including six lyos -- seven lyos, I believe two lines, a lot of packages equipment and a lot of things.
We just took everything out and sent them to Portugal at the time it was 180 containers that went -- came to Portugal. And in Portugal, we built two facilities using this equipment. It was built within record time. I think within two years we had the facilities up and running. The products were transferred at the time so we utilize those capacity immediately.
And then we had Xellia, they were looking for contract manufacturing at the time and we told them -- I know I had a meeting with them and I suggested that they could buy the remainder of the facility. I just wanted the R&D center to make sure that the transfers of these equipment of these products continue and the history and expertise were all within this R&D center.
So we decided that we will sell the rest of the facility the way it is without the equipment over the last site and keep only the R&D center and that's what we did. And since then Xellia had repair the last site that we kind of demolished to take all the equipment out and they put new technologies there, which is the aseptic bag filling technology, very complicated technology.
They also repaired their lyo. They spent a lot of money, a lot of money on it. I don't want to tell you the number, but it's in the hundreds of millions. And also there were successful of getting out of the consent decree.
So the site today is very different than how it was before from both regulatory side and capabilities. And this is why we were very enthusiastic actually, if we can get that site, we can get it going. It's right next to our R&D centers so transfers will be easy.
It's got the technologies that we need. The lyos are exactly the same type and the same model that we have here today at size. So transferring between sites become easier and the aseptic bag filling is a great technology that we've been wanting we've been looking at and we have a lot of products that we're developing that needed this technology.
So all in all, we felt that it really fits and we went after it. And I think we were successful in having an agreement with Xellia to acquire the assets. You want to do the FTC, Bill?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, on the FTC side. So we're not anticipating the need to divest to divest anything of any meaning. So we're not expecting the FTC process will result in any meaningful divestitures of products from our side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. Peter Verdult, Citi. I've got a few, but Riad and Bill, I'll ask them one at a time not to give you overload and some of them will only require very short answers. Just the current portfolio today that you talk about $75 million is that sort of sticky business declining growing business?
And when the pipeline comes through, should we assume that you think this can match the sort of high synergistic growth outlook you're giving for injectables. Just the current state of play of that business you're acquiring today and what the pipeline might be in terms of transforming the growth outlook?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Riad, I'll take that one. So the business today is we do see it as sticky. So the bulk of the product deal is around Vanco Ready to use it is a patented product in the US. So we have patent life out quite a ways on that product.
So we're expecting that revenue stream to be quite sticky. And we are looking at some opportunities and the potential to even grow that further than it was under Xellia when it gets into our commercial organization. Then as far as the pipeline as well --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill when you say --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, go ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, so ahead. Apologies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So on the R&D side, I'd say it's probably similar. So it's similar types of products for the most part that are in in R&D there. Those will be originally planned most of them will be originally planned to be outside of the CMO just based on the timing, it's going to take to get the Bedford site back up and running the way we wanted to run. And then we see those products with even more increased margin as we bring them back in-house once that facility is ready to accept them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Bill, just to follow up on the IPO on Vanco Ready, can I push you roughly when does that currently expire?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I knew you were going to ask me that question. I don't remember the exact patent expiry. I think it's -- don't quote me on it, but I think it's in the sometime in the early 2030s.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I won't hold you that. Okay, then speeding up just on, are you willing to discuss what the contingent is raised to? Is that a specific product in the pipeline or is that a sales milestone? Anything you're willing to say on that contingent?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Riad, do you want to handle that one? You want me to handle it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, go ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So on that, there's some milestone triggers around sales on a specific product. I don't think we can probably say too much more about that, unless Riad feels like it --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But I think it's definitely beneficial. I think it's definitely something that we'd be excited to -- if it happens, would be excited to pay would be willing to pay happily. So there are good milestones, I think for both of us, I think if we can get that, I think will be great for a lot of our companies.
I just want to tell you, I wanted to say a couple of things about why we are shutting down the site for 2 years, 2.5 years, something like that. I just want everybody to understand what the rationale behind it. I think we believe that the site today is very well equipped. It's got the right equipment, but we don't think that it's kind of it would be as flexible as what we would like it to be.
We've been in the lyo business now for 20 years, since that time we've got into the lyos. We know how best to run this type of process and we think that we need to redesign certain things with the lines, the way that we load those lyos and unload those lyos.
We believe that automation and this process is very important for many reasons for the quality reasons, but also for efficiency. If you want to show those lyos need to be always running it's like when they're not running, you basically are losing money.
So in order for you to make sure that they're continuously running, you need to load them and unload them at the fastest rate. What we do here in Portugal, after many years of experimentation, we have a automatic loading and unloading that does this extremely efficiently without having any operators needed. So this is the type of installation that we need to have in this plant.
And we elected to stop production they were producing, but we elected to stop completely and work on it because you really can't run half of site and you can't run a site and fix it at the same time. It's just this is asking for trouble, it's like changing a flat tyre as the car is running.
You really need to stop do it right, validated correctly, bring the right people in, train them and come in strongly with the capacity that you need with the products validated as you go.
So that's why we elected to stop running redesign it, put the equipment that we need automate it as much as possible. This is the US, so you really need it to be automation for many reasons, efficiently, quality, but most importantly, also cost. And then as we are ready, we will bring in the products and transfer all the products in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Last two for me, Riad, I know I've hogged the call, but hopefully you don't mind. You've been very clear since you assumed the CEO role that you're not interested in buybacks and dividends, you want to invest in the business. This is obviously a bolt-on strategic, still gives you lots of firepower I think you've talked about a [$1 billion] in the past.
So just could you high level give us a sense of the environment to do further business development. Is improving, remain the same. I realize you're not going to tell us what you're looking at. But just -- I just want to kick the tyres in terms of whether the environment to do more BD is improving or not.
And then just because we've got you on the line, when we look at the IQVIA data for both injectables and US generics, the trends are very favorable. So just we'd love to get your sense of how you think the business is doing. It feels that they're firing all cylinders, just wanted to kick the tyres with you and checking them out?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, as far as the environment and the BD environment, we've been looking at a lot of opportunities. We're trying to find opportunities that fit with the needs that we have. We need to we've been talking to all, but as you know, would be the -- it's you have to study 20 to get 1, if you're lucky.
So we've been very, very active, I think there are a lot of assets that are available today. We're looking to see we've been very active. We had to increase our BD department with a lot of resources. We're looking all over the world in all divisions and not only in injectables, but also in MENA and in the generics and we're busy.
So I think this is a good, great asset that we found and we would jump on it. And we've been really negotiating this for quite some time, maybe a few months. And similarly with other also opportunities we're doing the same.
So we're excited, I mean, we're happy that we have a strong balance sheet that we can use it wisely and we need to make sure that what the priorities of what we need to invest in first. So that's what exactly what we're doing.
As far as how we're doing, we are in line I think things are good. We're aggressive we're doing some changes, small changes to the organization that is giving us big benefits and the way that we're organized and the way we collaborate some of the organizational changes also give a lot more efficiency to the processes that we have.
And we're seeing a lot of results for a -- as a result of those changes. So I'm excited, I think things are going in the right direction and hopefully will be coming in with the good news routinely to the market and the market can have a huge trust in the growth and sustainability of this business.

Max Herrmann, Stifel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Herrmann, Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Hopefully you can hear me. Just three questions, if I may. In terms of the a creation R&D facility. Can you give us a little bit more color on how many people and what the -- assumes this is all anti-infectives, but it is that kind of core business that was doing R&D for Xellia? That's the first question.
Second one was just on in terms of other products beyond the Vanco Ready. I see there's daptomycin product. Is that again as a branded, is there any promotion going behind these as they find themselves as a specialty pharma business? Then just in terms of your thoughts in terms of the increased complexity of the business this will add obviously adds quite a few new locations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill, you want to take the R&D part?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I'll take a run at both and then you can add on. So the Croatia, R&D side, we're taking substantially all of the team and in the R&D center in Croatia, minus a few that I won't get into on the call. That site is primarily focused into ready to dilute, ready to deliver, ready to use types of products.
So that's mostly what the pipeline is there and it's consistent with the commercial products that they've developed. It has been the R&D center for Xellia pharmaceutical business. And so that will be coming to us. Those are primarily the skill sets that they have there. As far as the products go so the Vanco Ready to use does have some level of promotion. The daptomycin product that you referenced really generally does not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you want to talk about daptomycin?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Herrmann, Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you elaborate in terms of how many people promoting it and how many people are at the R&D facility?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I don't know that we are prepared to talk about the exact number of people at the at the R&D center today, I think we'll have to share that at a later point. On the commercial side for Vanco Ready to use and the daptomycin product, we are taking substantially all of the commercial organization from Xellia as well in the US. So we'll make sure we have a seamless transition of Vanco Ready to use and Dapto products into our portfolio and make sure we don't have any hiccups with respect to sales.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So if I may add a couple of things to what Bill has said from the R&D point of view from the center, I think Zagreb is going to add significant capacity of R&D, but not only for the US being in Europe also, they can also help us is some of the growth that we're experiencing in Europe and some of the support in both R&D and regulatory.
I think those are things that Bill was thinking about was and they will come. We need to, of course, reorganize and look at how are we going to run this. But that's what we're thinking is in EU and it can support both territories.
Daptomycin is a product that is -- it's not the usual daptomycin that they have, it is a specialty daptomycin. I think it's room temperature, correct me if I'm wrong, Bill, but I think it's a room temperature daptomycin while the regular one is a controlled temperature and which gives us a little bit of an edge over the competition. It's a very crowded market, but we think that we can gets some edge there. Bill, you want to correct me, if I'm wrong?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, you're right. So yeah, there is some benefit. It just doesn't require any significant detailing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. And the complexity of the injectable, yeah, I mean, this is as you grow, it becomes more complex, but I think it's something that we were expecting. I think the US is our largest market and we're happy that this one will be servicing this market will be in that market.
And especially of bags, we have a premix bags here in Portugal, but as shipping becomes expensive, the bags the cost of shipping a bag becomes very, very expensive as well. These are big, bulky and heavy bags that you ship across the ocean.
At the end, we will pay a lot of money, and we now it's a little bit better but during COVID times and sometime after COVID, it was really costing us a lot to ship those across.
So being in the US in the market that we can sell with those bags, I think gives us an advantage. I think we can service the market not only with faster, but also its relatively inexpensive in comparison to shipping all the way from Europe. So this is why we're excited about making the center of excellence for bag manufacturing in that facility.

James Vane-Tempest, Jefferies - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple if I may, please. Firstly, just thinking about the capacity. You've talked about numbers of lines. I appreciate that volumes and units are probably product-specific, but can you give a sense in terms of how much this site could expand your overall unit production capacity, please?
Second question is just on the pipeline of 11 projects, I'm just wondering what kind of markets you're addressing and to give us a feel as to when these could come through and materiality of those, please? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I'll take the first one and Bill can talk to you about the pipeline. So from the capacity point of view, I can tell you units, but you see and when it comes to lyo, it's very hard to do it in units because every product has a different drying time. So a product can dry in the lyo in 24 hours and some products takes seven, eight days.
So it's not fair to say the units, but I can tell you today, for example, in Portugal, we have 10 lyos. It's pretty big capacity and the lyo -- we will be adding 6 to those 10 that we have. So we'll be adding about 60% more to the existing network that we have for the US market so it is significant.
And they are a 300 square foot each. So if you look at it from a square footage point of view, it's also a significant number of square footage -- lyo square footage that you're adding. Also that we are -- the way that you run the lyos is important for you to maximize your output.
So this is why we're really investing and creating a very efficient process of loading and unloading those lyos. So drying time, you can't change much this is inherited in the properties of the product but you can load lyo and unload lyo becomes the process is can save you a lot of time and therefore, you can just turn to lyos around and go for other batches.
So just to give you an example, lyo like this would probably fit around the 100,000 at in load 100,000 [two ml vials] a little bit more than that. So 100,000 needs to be loaded in the 12 shelves, I believe or something like this. And then they would have to be loaded and it would have to be unloaded.
So the process is very complicated and it has to be done in such a delicate very important way because you'd be loading several product as you all know stoppers, not all the way seated. So it requires -- you have to be extremely careful about how to do it.
We experimented in a lot of different ways here in Portugal, but in the last few years, in the last I would say, seven, eight years, when we started now adding the new capacity, we now do automatic loading, no humans, no room for contamination. And we thought this is the best most efficient and very much big assurance to the quality.
So this is what we're planning to do there. So it does add significant and if we automate it, I think it will be a very, very significant amount of products coming out of that facility. Bill, you want to take the pipeline?

Bill Larkins, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - President - Injectables    [45]

Yeah, so on the pipeline. So it's there's, as Riad had mentioned in his introduction, there are 10 products in the pipeline for the Xellia R&D center. We are one of those was recently filed. There's a kind of a wave of timelines for the existing remainder of those products.
We're expecting those to start launching in the 2025 timeframe and kind of launch throughout the rest of the decade. So we're expecting that there'll be some meaningful growth opportunities out of those products.
And then also, as Riad mentioned, we're intending to really leverage that Croatia R&D center as well. We're going to be adding additional product opportunities into that center as well from our list of interesting pipeline products.

Operator,     [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have no further questions. So I'll now hand back to Riad for some closing remarks.

Riad Mishlawi, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC - Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, thank you, everybody. I hope that we answered all your questions. Again, I just wanted to reiterate that we think that this is a very exciting opportunity, especially for the strategic potential of this acquisition and I hope that we can demonstrate that in the future. So thank you very much and see you soon.
