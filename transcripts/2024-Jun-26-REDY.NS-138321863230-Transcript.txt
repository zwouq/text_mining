--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Richa. Good morning and good evening to all of you. Thank you for joining this call at such short notice. Really appreciate it. I'm delighted to announce that today we signed an agreement with [Elan] plc to acquire the Global Consumer Healthcare portfolio in the nicotine replacement therapy. So call it a multi category in line with our stated strategy. We have consistently maintained that in addition to focusing on our core business of generics, biosimilars in API, we would also be investing was the driver of the future, a future of it's in three areas. One is access to novel molecules that can [NCEs, NBEs, CAR-T] digital sound politics in Consumer Healthcare, including nutrition and OTC wellness products.
We have been increasing our processes, Consumer Healthcare, including two recent acquisitions of women's health portfolio in the US, namely mental lapse and Prima for menopause and 13, respectively, a launch of anti-allergy medication at least aligned the UK in a nutraceutical joint venture with Netflix India to bring well-known global range of nutraceutical health solution of Nestle Health Science to India. Through these acquisitions, we are adding a market-leading brand, a vacancy nail along with three local market-leading grades such as nickel-based heavy toll and site store portfolio in all formats such as those things, page gum as well as pipeline assets outside of the US.
The [Cottonelle] is the second biggest brand globally, excluding the United States, the nicotine replacement therapy category, the brand's successful footprint in 30 plus markets, mostly in developed markets like Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand Japan and with the potential for expansion in emerging markets complementing and building on our existing global presence and capabilities. This acquisition give us strong footprint in Europe as well as other global markets as well as access to key customers, making this a perfect anchor around which a global OTC platform will be built.
The portfolio has maintained steady sales over the years with revenue of 217, a UK power generated in 2023. The portfolio also has healthy profitability and is margin accretive for Dr. Reddy's, the acquisitions will be for a total consideration of GBP500 million, including an upfront cash payment of GBP458 million, an earn-out payment of up to GBP42 million payable in a calendar year of 2025 and 2026. This acquisition will be funded through internal accruals. The closing of the transaction of the transaction is subject to satisfaction, a satisfactory completion of customary conditions and regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in early Q4 of calendar year 2024.
Operation will move a to us in a phased manner, and we will leverage established supply relationships to ensure a seamless transition. While the focus over the next few quarters will be on successful integration of this acquisition, leveraging our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow that will continue to be generated. We will continue to identify and evaluate value-creating inorganic opportunities and business deals across geographies, including India. We have made progress on our pipeline and over the next two to three years, we are planning certain key launches with significant revenue contribution from complex generic, including peptides and biosimilars.
Our in-house R&D efforts will be a will also be complemented by collaborations. In recent months, we have successfully concluded multiple strategic collaborations for near-term and long-term business drivers such as appeal to markets and Officeworks sales in payers, heart failure drug in India. So that's in our long-term collaborations with Amgen in India, initiate a joint venture with Nestle India for nutrition product with Alberta, flotel biosimilars, denosumab in the US., UK and Europe, with the Anika for refractory migraine management device, [Desigual], India, South Africa and multiple markets in Europe.
This deal marks an important milestone in building global consumer healthcare business and taking this step closer towards our medium to long-term goals. I would like to reiterate that the acquisition of global portfolio, including grain because the mill is a logical extension of our efforts to pursue that give or OTC in the recent years. I'm looking forward to strong execution and to continued growth in momentum in the base business as well as seamless integration of the acquired assets in the coming quarters.
With this, I would like to open the floor for questions and answers.

q-and-a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions)
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the opportunity. The first question is on the profitability of the acquired business. While we have said that it is accretive to our profitability and provide some colour as to what has been the EBITDA margin and operating margin for this business and how it has made it last three years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, thank you, Kunal. This asset is a very profitable and we are going to use some of this profit also for investment in the brand asset base we believe that there's an opportunity to grow the brand as well as a there are certain considerations of expenses that will have to include the beginning. So if you add all of that, it should be in line of ours, no normal guidelines, even maybe a plus of eight of the 25%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. And then secondly, about when you look at our current OTC business. The first part is what is the size of our current OTC business? And if you can give some colour as to how it is split between US and other than US market? And then how does this acquisition fit into our current piece of OTC business? And do you see any cost synergies coming out of it and the revenue synergies coming out of it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So it's primarily aim a complementary to what we have. We have about 140 million of business today of the suite across markets. This is by design complementary to this effort, this deal is not including the US. So this deal is primarily outside of the US in which way in which especially in markets in which we have what we see, but it's not as big in stone in the end, it can serve as a platform because now you have access to customers and access to a access to and to markets and access to talent that allow you to bring more products.
And just say Kunal using your questions to extend. We have we call it an ankle deal, meaning that is around that we can continue to add assets to it because we have the basic capabilities to invest behind it. So it's primarily complementary. A the main synergies will come by the ability to grow the assets there to use it as a platform for additional products and to go to markets in which we will now do not have the relevant persons from [Zurich] in India, China and other markets.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is one like what we have been doing with our and then the portfolio will utilize it for the US portfolio, utilizing it for the other markets, similar kind of mean which of the cross-selling opportunities is the way to say?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so and we can actually use this portfolio for other markets. Absolutely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, I am (technical difficulty)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Kunal, I just want to clarify that. It is mentioned that our current OTC business is about $140 million. That's in our North American business globally. Our OTC business is approximately 10% of our total business, which is in excess of $300 million. So I hope that clarifies.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. And thank you for that too.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neha Manpuria, Bank of America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neha Manpuria, BofA Securities - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, hi. I hope I'm audible. Sir, you know, on the platform that we've acquired, but how do you think that can grow and if I were to take a slightly longer view on the entire OTC business from the current $300 million with the likely portfolio, the menopause acquisition in the US. How big can it be for Dr. Reddy's, let's say, in fiscal 27, 28, how should we think about the size of the potential of this business, including the acquisitions in a few years from now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So obviously, we are aiming for a very sizable opportunity. So if you are a depends a lot on the timeframe that we are discussing the. So for the initial part of your question, it is primarily a day. The this type of business was not a priority for Allianz and they did not invest much in this business, we believe that there is an opportunity to grow this business by investing in it. That's why also guided for the 25%. We want to use some of the money to invest in it if this is in the current geographies. In addition to that, there is ability to come to other geographies, especially in Asia. And if you're at the other components of the LTC., like you mentioned, Nestle stuff. This is, of course, is adding hundreds of millions of dollars to this, but some of it will build over time because these are brands that needs to be introduced, it being the of course, built organically over time.
So what you're going to see say it's say it's kind of the organic growth of those brands. But absolutely, we are aiming for a significant sizable team this one day, hopefully speaking in the OTC and after all of those moves will happen that in the in terms of 26, 27, 28 a year, it's about moderate growth of the production, say a the activities, a lot of products that will not launch, it will not impact significantly by that period of time. It will take more time for them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neha Manpuria, BofA Securities - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So essentially for the existing $300 million base to double and it will take us longer. Is that a fair assumption?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It can be even triple that it just a matter of what is the time that it will take the current business is now growing in single digits. And we and we believe that we can grow it faster than what it is. The only places that are was related to a build new brands, like in the case of Nestle, this will take more time. Yes, it will because we [need to in 2002] and normally it takes three to four years to establish a good brand in the market from Zone like India.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Aghanian, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, European Generics    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(multiple speakers) I'm sorry, sir, I wanted to, My name is Patrick Aghanian and I just wanted to add what [Peter] was just mentioning, I think in this category you need to look at it in two contracts as the first is the macro drivers, both in developed and developing markets. Whilst in developed markets, smoking has classical smoking cleaning tobacco cigarette smoking sorry, has declined.
It has unfortunately been overtaken by new introductions such as vaping and this phenomenon we see, especially amongst younger population in developed markets. Fortunately, governments are now beginning to take action against to writing, and we see our role to play in that in developing markets where still some cigarette smoking is very prevalent, sin taxes as imposed by the governments are relatively low, certainly compared to developed markets. We still see a lot of opportunities in the years ahead as more and more governments take up the funds against the smoking.
Just also mention that in addition to sin taxes and other regulations, the simple legislation such as tradition of smoking in closed spaces, or it also is hugely impactful in terms of driving this category.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neha Manpuria, BofA Securities - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood, thank you for that, but just to follow up. If you was able to mentioned adding more products to this platform we have a we already have an allergy medicines OTC product in Europe. Is there complementary aspects to, adding more products that the market access health. Is that why the growth will accelerate over time?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Aghanian, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, European Generics    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So sorry, your voice is not so clear. I understood the first part of your question, but not the second part. The first part was are there any other products? And then the second part, I didn't catch sorry, about that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neha Manpuria, BofA Securities - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, does the platform really helps to add products, add more assets to it. Does that accelerate the growth of the OTT platform or does it have operating leverage benefits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Aghanian, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, European Generics    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So first of all, this asset comes with a pipeline of new launches in consumer healthcare space, innovation is I suppose innovation is critical in any business but in consumer healthcare as well. So there is a pipeline of new products which are growing, which are already underway in factor as they have just launched, sprays at the beginning of this year in the Nordic countries in Europe.
And sprays are indicated, for example and they are going to expand this other products are going to be also introduced in the next few years. So there is a pipeline of new products which is coming with this asset.
And the second thing about this asset, that it's straddles 30 plus countries. And although the top 12 accounts for roughly 80% of the business and the top 12 also straddle continents starting from Canada, all the way to Japan and Australia and New Zealand. And the size of these businesses in each of those countries is not small, meaning this is not an asset where you have one country dominating and then have a lot of small countries of which are just the asset sale. It's actually very healthy is sizable businesses in each one of those countries.
Third, this is a asset that allows us to interface with retailers and whether it's pharmacy chains or mass market retailers. These are very sophisticated operators and this particular category is very valued by them. It's very valued by them for two reasons to one because it actually promotes health. And this is very important from the point of view of the retailers for their point of view of image. I suppose. And the second reason is because it's a very high priced license for their for their for their selection of products. And since we are the number two brands in this category and it positions us very nicely to play a role and also have access to these retailers, which then, of course, allows us to leverage other products which we are developing whether it's in this category or other categories in order to gain space on the shelf.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neha Manpuria, BofA Securities - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. That's very clear. Thank you so much sir.

Abdul Qadir [Guranwala], ICICI Securities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abdul Qadir, ICICI Securities - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, hi. Thank you for the opportunity. So first question is on I know the asset base. So the revenue part is quite understood. Are you also going to acquire a manufacturing units or, you know, some sort of an asset base along with the this entire business?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I can take the question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Aghanian, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, European Generics    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, please take. So this assets, this business is asset-light. There is no manufacturing facility which is associated with this business. It is served by CMOs and the CMOs are located primarily in Europe from the Production process for these products is actually it is complicated and a capital intensive. There are not that many suppliers and the relationship that this business has with the CMOs is long-standing stretches for more than 20 years, and we look forward to working with those CMOs in order to drive this business forward. In line with our strategic aspirations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abdul Qadir, ICICI Securities - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right understood. Your second question is on what kind of approvals you will require before you close this transaction? I mean, are there any major stringent government regulations with two can be a potential burden with the completion of this acquisition.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think we have any questions from people on the line, but I can check the answer to the question, there are four approvals that we would need. We believe all of them are manageable. They're actually located in most emerging markets, Brazil, the the merger control kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we need to also and United Arab Emirates, another one where needed. And finally, there is one approval that will deplete Washington, but other than that. So there are no other approvals that are necessary for the completion of this transaction. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abdul Qadir, ICICI Securities - Analyst    [29]

Thank you.

Damayanti Kerai, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India, Private Limited.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damayanti Kerai, HSBC, Research Division - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. My question is regarding the initial cost or investment you which you might require to grow this particular franchise so can you quantify like what kind of spend you are foreseeing for this franchise and the scale of our dues? Do you think the margins can improve significantly from the current level, which you indicated it from 25%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I can I try to answer this question, but first, before I tried to answer your question, I'd like to speak and listen to it about the specifics of this business. I see you need to know a little bit why it is such an attractive asset so that you may appreciate what I'm about to answer to your question. First of all, this is a business which by its very nature, it's very complex for the consumer. The consumer has and psychological factor at play when they are taking this therapy, to stop smoking and they know it's harmful for them, but it's come to us and it takes anywhere between eight to 30 a ton during the lifetime.
I repeat again, there are different sources of data that at least we have analysed shows that there are anywhere between 18 to 30 attempts during the lifetime of before a consumer successfully quit smoking. So we see it very, very long term and long-term play here with this with this category.
As already mentioned, this business has not been a priority for Dalian for a while. And therefore, the investments have been kept at a level which is very, very high, which is low. And for us to grow this business and also to address the unmet needs. We know that they exist, whether it's existing unmet need or future unmet need, for example, baking I mentioned earlier. Clearly, we have to invest more and increased the level of investments, which we plan, which we plan to do in line versus this time, which in line with what our aspiration is.
So indicatively speaking, we will be increasing our A&P investments, but also our capabilities in terms of understanding the consumer for this is very important. Not the marketing tools available today were not available 20 years ago when you're trying to engage a consumer in a very complex psychological dynamic. What was available 20 years ago was a very simple, probably 32nd ad on TV and some editorials today, you have a full gamut of two such a disposal, some of which are actually very cost effective they were not so cost effective previous what equity exist. So yes, we need to we will be seeking to industry growth business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damayanti Kerai, HSBC, Research Division - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(multiple speakers) just to add to that, we see we and this is why I guided that it is margin accretive and it is absolutely within the guidelines that we normally do. We will use that in the same way, meaning for us the 25% is always a 10 of a, say, a decision, not an outcome, meaning we want to use the excess of this to invest into the future. And this is where we believe is the sweet spot that is also relevant for the asset. The asset has a potential to go beyond that whilst we feel that we will invest and we put everything in place for long term for sure. But in the short term, by the eyes to that, it will be accretive. It will enable us the growth that we want and the total shareholder return. But to a at the same time, we want to use the excess to reinvest in this business.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damayanti Kerai, HSBC, Research Division - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. And my second question is they brought on OTC products. So in OTC., what will be the most important factor, which you should focus a differentiated product set that you are? Number two, were they adjacent to what will differentiate your number two position versus the number one position or number three position.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So first of all, this brands, as I already indicated, occupies the number two position in the markets that we operate by the way in one market, it's actually number one in the Netherlands, which is number one position In other markets, it's a very strong number two globally speaking, and it is a very resilient business, as I indicated, with more levels of A&P support, not only have the volumes and the value being maintained. They have even grown in some cases faster than the average for the category. So plus, as I already indicated, with the consumers going through a cycle of AC 30 quit attempts during the lifetime. It's a very sticky business, which is extremely interesting from a marketing point of view.
So we need to we need to build on what has been done in the past, and we need to tried to engage with existing consumers who are clearly over the past 20 years or 25 years since this brand is in existence and also trying to expand to new consumers. I mentioned thinking, especially amongst young people, which is really a phenomenon that is not very nice to see. People unfortunately have impression that they think is actually less harmful. It is not the case. There's simply not enough data yet, but that data is being generated anyway.
When you speak to governments, clearly they are beginning to understand that pricing is not as harmless as a tobacco companies have made it up to the. So we also have to start targeting those consumers. I already mentioned that North Star of the NRT. business of helium has launched a particular product in the Nordics, specifically with an indication for vaping spray that will be expanded to other markets in Western Europe and then there is emerging market emerging markets already. This business has a good footprint in emerging markets in countries such as Brazil, Korea, in Southeast Asia, for example, Hong Kong and as Singapore, et cetera. And there are clearly opportunities there that you see Saudi Arabia, I already mentioned, start, et cetera, et cetera. So we have to do that to fill build and then targeted to consumers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damayanti Kerai, HSBC, Research Division - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. That's helpful. Thank you for response.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [38]

Bino Pathiparampil from Elara Capital.
The line for the current questioner has been dropped. We move on to the next question.
Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you for this opportunity. My first question on about the NRT to see what is the outlook of NRT in the winter on the video as a clarification to our earlier commentary that you mentioned energy is declining in that world market, but it is progressing in the developing markets. Is it right that understanding end of what is the growth outlook, your NAFTA, the therapy and of what is the what is its positioning compared to alternate therapy for drug smoking cessation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I understood your question the first question, sorry, I have to repeat it so that I make sure I understood your question. Your first question was, what is the growth prospects? And second question was, what are the alternatives that if I understand you correctly to NRG?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, yes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So first of all, in terms of growth, I thought I heard you said that there's been a decline. I don't believe we said there has been a decline as the category actually has been growing in across all geographies in the mid single digits, a little bit lower than mid-single digits. Nonetheless, it's been growing. When you look forward to that, we believe that this growth will be accelerated. First of all, as I indicated, this business comes with a new product innovation and this business has not had any new launches over the last, I don't know, maybe seven years, eight years. So it's been start of new launches.
And now we are we have a pipeline of new launches that are going to be to be introduced from the. Furthermore, we are going to support the business in terms of additional A&P spend. And so we believe that are going to accelerate the growth across the different geographies. As said, that there are also a new segments opening up, which is around baking, as I indicated, is a unfortunately a big issue. What we are seeing in both developed and developing markets. We believe that developing markets, we'll also start targeting classical smoking with additional SIM taxes and also more restrictions on where people are allowed to smoke.
This will definitely keep as further push for people to trade a quitting to smoke. By the way the energy category is our official be recommended and approved by the WHO. So this is a very important consideration for us in Dr. Reddy's and in terms of alternatives well, and there are alternatives that are available. For example, there are prescription medications such as a book for bupropion and very clean. This is available after their prescription drug and their mode of action is different targets because nicotine receptors in the brain. But nevertheless, that's an option. And there are, of course, behavioral therapies which people can use mostly in the area of psychological support and counseling I hope I've answered your question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, yes. So my second point was also that the WHO recommendation to include and is that it's incredibly tough medicine. What does that really mean in the emerging markets, Florida markets other than the US. And have you seen any benefit or have you seen any benefit happening to this energy therapy? Was the recommendation in 2020?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry. Again, I if I understood you correctly, you were asking whether this NRT therapy and if we see opportunities in developing markets, which then will not mean?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, no, no, sorry, I'm repeating my question here. How should one read this WHO recommendation that NRP is part of food items and list of medicines? So this is well documented in 2020. Have you seen any benefit accruing to this NRT? And how should the Board progressively this recommendation should benefit us?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So in definitely, the WHO recommendation is what also makes it attractive for a company like Dr. Reddy's. And we are a science-based company and we deal with products which are very important in terms of the unmet medical need. And in terms of what we are seeing in emerging markets, we are seeing more and more government tenders. So for example, we are seeing a pretty big government centers going up post 2020. At the biggest thing that has happened recently is in Brazil where this business has won a significant tender with the Brazilian health authorities.
But it is also the same, for example, in Saudi Arabia and in other geographies. And we believe there are other geographies where ADM has pumping presence as Haley entering a British company historically has not been very active in, for example, French but Africa average for Sally, French speaking, North Africa, such as Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, et cetera. And now we can potentially access those markets to our businesses that we are first sets of recently in those places. So yes, we do see we do see increased interest by the side of covenants.

Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And just last question from my side, it's a clarification in fact. And what you mentioned is in the initial commentary that this is a business, it will require investment too. We'll take it forward but even after the investment in terms of the profitability and our margins, this will still have margin beyond 25%. Is that and depending yes, these understanding right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, we are saying they're always getting we are comfortable around the 25% as a decision. And that's what we are. We plan to maintain the business at least initial stage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surya Narayan Patra, PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Yeah, Thank you sir. Congratulations for the transaction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bino Joseph Pathiparampil, Elara Securities (India) Private Limited - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey good evening, I hope you can hear me?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, please go ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bino Joseph Pathiparampil, Elara Securities (India) Private Limited - Analyst    [54]

How does this product sell it only to direct. It does happen to the customer and are there any regulatory restrictions around that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the product is primarily classified as an over-the-counter medication. In some instances, this is also classified as a prescription medication. It depends on the specific country regulation, but in most of the instances, it's an over-the-counter medication in-country. So for example, the developed countries, it is sold both in pharmacies as well as outside pharmacies for example in supermarkets, for example, in the UK there was a supermarket chain called Tesco, Sainsbury's. You will find the product in those type of outlet. I hope I answered your question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bino Joseph Pathiparampil, Elara Securities (India) Private Limited - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. So on so that the acquisition comes with the necessary marketing and sales team because we will need a hybrid team write off for direct marketing as well as searching for prescription marketing to the physicians to order. Does this acquisition come with the team?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The transaction involves a combination of a transfer of certain employees from Dalian. And I'm sorry, I cannot comment further on that because there is a consultation process in place. Actually, it started with the works councils. So that's all I have to say in terms of the transfers from existing employees. And we also have built a new We have also hired people in addition to that.
Yes, well, the answer to your question is there is not going to be hybrids in the lab in them, most of the businesses as OPC. So we will manage it. And you see in the countries in which will require sales force, which is prescription it, we will and we will use it either in our people or use a partner for them, but it's not an Hydrogenic. One of the country is mostly OTC for precision, but but you don't need a hybrid model.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bino Joseph Pathiparampil, Elara Securities (India) Private Limited - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood from second, are the people who get to this product or stop smoking or vaping? How long do they typically use this product to the use it or pretty much lifelong? Or is it like a few weeks and then they stop everything, all types of hotels?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's this is an excellent question, It's a very fast. And I wish I had a we have a long time for me to answer this question because I have lots of slides, but as I can show you there are different types of consumers. There are consumers who use this product as a stopgap measure. They use it so that they don't have to come back, meaning they have already quit. They don't want to restart. So they don't want to be you have relapsers. So they use it in that contract and there are those who don't want to quit, but they want to reduce the number of cigarettes or that they are smoking. So there are many different types of consumers who actually choose this product.
It's not just one or two that's what makes it so interesting and so attractive because the each type of consumer has its own specific driver enter and needs on the average on the average of when somebody let's say he wants to quit. They are they consume the products from anywhere between six months to a year, generally what happens because the first or second time that they're trying to quit or even the third time they go into a relapse, they start smoking again. Then they are unhappy. They start. They make a new commitment.
They say, okay, I'm going to stop smoking, then they start again and so forth and so forth. So it goes through this cycle of a start, a staff retreat a cycle high. Once you are just as a little bit of humour. Hopefully I know slates are good for you with me, but this is a tumour Mark Twain. Some of the American Water had a very interesting thing to say to Senator, do you think of smoking is the easiest thing in the world? I know because I've done this thousands of times. So this is I think the best way to describe what the consumer actually goes through when they're trying to stop smoking. And this is a nice product.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bino Joseph Pathiparampil, Elara Securities (India) Private Limited - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. Thank you. And finally, just one thing, if you could share some rough market share of the number one player and yourself in the overall record in replacement market for the rough number indication, just to see how fragmented the market is?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So first of all, this is a highly stratified market, meaning for example, we are number two, the difference between the number two brand and the number two and number three brands is a factor of four times. It's a factor of 4x. I repeat again for us. So this is very, very important as it shows the strength of the brands. And of roughly speaking, the depending on the geography, I think we are about 25% market share and across across the different geographies and things. One, we think I wanted to say now sits my mind, but if it comes back conduction, so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bino Joseph Pathiparampil, Elara Securities (India) Private Limited - Analyst    [62]

Shrikant Akolkar, Nuvama Group - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if it is possible for you to look at the manufacturing back to India and there are some CDMOs offering such services?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So this business has some currency and also setup on the relationship with the current CMOs is a long-standing they stretch back, as I indicated to many years, in some cases going back to the 1990s. We are looking forward to continuing to work with these CMOs to first ensure a smooth transition and to look forward to building this business going forward. New products is very important and the development of these new products also depends to a large extent on these relationships. So we are looking forward to that as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shrikant Akolkar, Nuvama Group - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And the product development part is done by [helion] or the CDMO partner?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the brand owner together with the CMO. But the actual work is done at the CDMO. So if you will, the idea generation and 50% content is coming from the brand owner in this case, in the future of salaries for the actual work is done is outsourced to CDMOs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shrikant Akolkar, Nuvama Group - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood, a little larger question. So last few months, we have seen several initiatives such as agotic collaboration, [Nestle JV] announced this acquisition. We already have invested in the CDMO business and then they are very potent peptide biosimilar R&D projects. So what are the key priorities going forward with so many moving parts in the business.
And if you can also towards the end of this question, if you can answer about the ROC expectation over the next four to five. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So as we stated in the past, we have two types of businesses. And I'm talking now in the high-level one is the B2B business, which is primarily leverage business. This result, also legacy business of generics and API, which will contribute to invest in growth, primarily with productivity with products launching across markets and in gaining global market share as part of it and the enterprise.
And we added to it the bids at the horizon 2, which is to grow it and see it primarily by collaborations of NC NB CARTA nutraceutical and obviously in this kind of stuff as another was not a growth driver, the focus of those, yeah, India in those new markets as well as of course, Europe and the rest of the activities. We are committed by the way to grow in India.
We are committed to grow faster than the IPM. We are committed to be number five in India. Most of those investments in the something it with products that are better than the standard of care will be in India as well as emerging markets a wildly or to see is more of a global play from the reason that we discuss. So this is helping us to establish what we call an anchor business globally.
In terms of, say, our guidance for the future sales to the double digit to 25% EBITDA as a sweet spot in which we can both say, give enough total shareholder return as well as have enough to invest in business development. Again, this is in other ways. It's not every quarter, it's not every activity.
Sometimes we are above it, sometimes below it, the same for the IOC source in the future, we are planning to be in the same range of double digits, 25% EBITDA on average, 25% ROC on average. This business will absolutely add to this component. And we have enough financial capacity to go for additional businesses. So this is not the end of it. We are actually just at the beginning of the journey. It's okay.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shrikant Akolkar, Nuvama Group - Analyst    [70]

Tarang, Old Bridge.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Good evening and thank you for the opportunity and congratulations. A couple of questions. You know you spoke about investing more in the business. In order to grow it further, what kind of investments are we talking about? Are we talking about of say beefing up the product pipeline or, you know, more ad spends are picking up probably entering into new markets? Would that largely be what you mean by new investor -- more investment in the business?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, yes. It's a combination of all the three.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second, just spoke about the bridging on relationships with the customers. If you could elaborate a little more on this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Aghanian, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, European Generics    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. So this business is currently, as I said, sold through pharmacy chains and mass-market retailers, depending on the geography and which is very important to us for the success, and we are looking forward to continuing the business with those trade partners into the future. I already indicated the importance I don't want to repeat again, how important it is also for the retailers these category.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So probably use that as a platform to probably introduce other products. Which you'll have approvals for in those markets?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Aghanian, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer, European Generics    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly, yes, when we have access and we are already at the table, let's say with this category, it already makes it easier to talk about other things.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all the best.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you the opportunity again, just one on the broader revenue split for the acquired business between Europe, emerging market and other developed countries. If you can split this GBP217 million in this category?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the business is about 60% of the business comes from Europe in terms of turnover. And then we have a significant pieces coming from Australia, Canada, Japan and these countries combines leading European countries plus Australia, Canada and Japan and New Zealand then takes you to 80% of the total turnover hedging, let's say 4%. And then you have other countries in the bank such as Brazil, KSA and others, Hong Kong, et cetera.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And this is really helpful. And then two more question on the commodity business. So you said that we have a minimum or a product in the pipeline. Can you share what's the number of pipeline products and a bit more of a novel delivery system for the new containers is the way to think about it or there are, at least, the wholly-owned pipeline, whatever business we are currently paying.
The second is how has been the ASP increase in this brand and nicotine replacement therapy category in the last three, four years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, I did not understand the last part of your question. Could you repeat again?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The average selling price increase in the category in the last three to four years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erez Israeli, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd - Chief Executive Officer    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So first of all, on the new launches, as we get closer to launches, we will, of course, disclose them. I'm sure there's is a competitive landscape here as well that we have to take into consideration. As far as the pricing is concerned, you know, pricing power in Consumer Healthcare is directly related to branch power, the more the stronger your brands, the stronger pricing power, as we already discussed earlier about the strength of the brand. So there is a metric that's a higher-end malls, Consumer Healthcare, you have a good brand, things are more secure. We have a weaker brands and are less secure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Dhamesha, Macquarie Research - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thank you. And all the best.
