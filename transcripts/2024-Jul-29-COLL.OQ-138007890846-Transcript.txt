--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Chris. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We are excited to discuss Collegium's proposed acquisition of Ironshore Therapeutics, including its commercial product Jornay PM, a central nervous system stimulant for the treatment of ADHD in those six years of age and older. Collegium strategy to build a leading diversified pharmaceutical company is twofold, maximize the potential of our current pain portfolio, and strategically deploy capital to create value for our shareholders.
Our pain portfolio continues to deliver strong performance, generating an estimated $145 million in net revenue in the second quarter of 2024, up 7% year over year. We recently achieved several milestones that improve the outlook of our pain portfolio in 2025 and beyond.
The planned acquisition of Ironshore when closed is expected to deliver on each and every one of our strategic objectives related to business development. We will leverage our core competencies with respect to commercial execution and build on our proven track record of efficiently and successfully integrating commercial assets to build our portfolio.
We have been laser focused on identifying differentiated commercial growth assets that diversify our portfolio. Have significant revenue growth potential and have exclusivity into the 2030s. I ensure meets all of our criteria with Jornay PM.
Jornay PM is a differentiated commercial asset that will establish our presence in neurology, specifically the large and growing ADHD market and diversify our portfolio. Jornay PM as a significant growth potential, which will expand and diversify our revenue base, adding a new leading growth driver to our portfolio. Jornay PM has been growing rapidly, achieving 58% growth in prescriptions in 2023 and 32% growth in the first half of 2024. 2024 net revenues expected to be in excess of $100 million and Jornay PM is supported by 16 Orange Book-listed patents with expiries in 2032.
Importantly, this acquisition represents a step forward in our strategy to establish a commercial presence in a therapeutic area beyond pain management. By leveraging our strong commercial capabilities and our prior experience in efficiently and successfully integrating commercial acquisitions, we plan to fully maximize Jornays' potential in ADHD. With this acquisition, we are delivering on our commitments to improving the lives of people living with serious medical conditions, creating shareholder value, and building a leading diversified specialty pharmaceutical company.
I'd like to take a moment to congratulate the Ironshore team for building a strong business driven by the success of Jornay PM and fuelled by Ironshore's dedication to patients and caregivers in the ADHD community.
I'd also like to recognize my Collegium colleagues for their hard work and dedication. Your efforts in support of people and communities we serve as well as your work in support of this transaction reflect our commitment to operational execution and if it led us to this transformative moment. Collegium has a strong track record of successful business development, which has enabled the growth of our commercial portfolio, delivered durable revenue, and ultimately generated significant and consistent operating cash flows.
The acquisition Ironshore represents another highly accretive acquisitions that will further diversify our portfolio and expand our commercial presence in a large and growing market and serve as a step forward in building another therapeutic area of expertise.
I will now hand the call over to Scott to further discuss Jornay PM and the opportunity ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Dreyer, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. Jornay PM is a central nervous system stimulant to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD in people, six years of age and older in the United States. Jornay PM is highly differentiated and well positioned to grow. It's the only stimulant ADHD medication with convenient evening dosing. This is important for pediatric and adolescent patients because it eliminates the need to dose of school or at work.
Jornay PM also has flexible dose-dependent duration, enabling treatment to be tailored to the patient's needs. And lastly, it has smoothed symptom control throughout the day, limiting the need for short-acting stimulant add-ons.
We're thrilled to bring Jornay PM into our portfolio as it will establish a new commercial presence for Collegium in ADHD. Collegium is the leader in responsible pain management, and we have a proven track record of commercial success with our pain portfolio. We believe this acquisition presents an attractive opportunity to enter the neurology space by expanding into the large and growing ADHD market and enabling us to build another therapeutic area of expertise. There is significant unmet need in the ADHD market and Jornay PM has highly differentiated product that can address that need.
The ADHD market has grown 5% on average over the past four years. And over the past few years, Jornay PM has delivered significant double-digit prescription growth. In 2023, total prescriptions for Jornay PM grew 58% compared to 2022 to approximately 490,000 and through the first half of 2024 Jordan APM prescriptions have grown 32% year over year.
In addition, Jornay PM has a broad and growing prescriber base, approximately 15,000 prescribers per month, and it has strong market access. The ADHD business is concentrated to the commercial and Medicaid segments, about 60% commercial and 40% Medicaid and Jornay PM had 80% coverage across these segments.
With these strong fundamentals and clinical differentiation, we see significant opportunity for Jornay PM, and we believe it has the potential to be Collegium's leading growth driver, complementing our continued leadership position in responsible pain management.
As we've done with our current portfolio of pain products, we plan to maximize the value of Jornay PM and unlock its full growth potential by leveraging our proven commercial capabilities. These include strong market access, commercial operations, and experienced marketing differentiated products in highly competitive markets.
We have a proven track record of efficiently and successfully integrating commercial acquisitions and we'll leverage that experience to maximize the full potential of Jornay PM. We're excited to build upon the momentum that our colleagues at Ironshore have created for Jornay PM by raising awareness and increasing adoption of this highly differentiated product among health care providers, patients, and caregivers in the ADHD community.
I'll now hand the call over to Colleen to discuss key financials and next steps for the transaction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Collegium will acquire all the outstanding shares of Ironshore for $525 million in cash at closing. Collegium will also pay Ironshore shareholders $25 million in additional consideration if Jornay PM net revenue exceeds a defined threshold in 2025. The all-cash consideration will be funded by a combination of Collegium's existing cash on hand and a new $646 million secured financing from Pharmakon. A portion of these funds will also be used to replace our existing term loan with Pharmakon.
We secured very favorable terms, which will reduce the interest rate on our current debt of $320.8 million by 300 basis points. The new term loan has a five year term with an interest rate of [sulphur] plus 450 basis points and will be amortized over five years. In addition, to lowering our cost of capital, the new term loan has a longer term, a lower required amortization and more prepayment flexibility.
As a result of the transaction, we estimate that our net leverage at year end will be below 2 times based on estimated fiscal year 2024 pro forma combined EBITDA. We expect that our significant cash flow generation post transaction will enable us to deliver and maintain a strong balance sheet to fund our growth going forward.
The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024 subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to adjusted EBITDA at closing while being highly accretive to 2025 adjusted EBITDA.
We will generate additional cash flows from operations throughout the next year, and our use of cash will be prioritized to maximizing Jornay PM and strategically deploying capital. We also have $115 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. This transaction comes at a time of financial strength for Collegium, and we are excited to close the acquisition and continued Jornays' growth trajectory.
I will now turn the call back to Mike.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Colleen. Our focus continues to be on creating long-term value through operational execution. Our acquisition of Ironshore aligns with our mission and our strategic objectives. The addition of Jornay PM will diversify our portfolio, establish our presence in a growing market with unmet need that represents a step forward in building a new therapeutic area of expertise.
This acquisition will also strengthen our financial position by significantly expanding our revenue base, delivering immediate adjusted EBITDA accretion, and accelerating our cash flow generation. We believe this acquisition will create value for our shareholders as we continue to deliver record financial results, generate robust cash flows, and deploy capital in a disciplined manner. We look forward to closing this acquisition into welcoming the Ironshore team to Collegium.
I will now open the call up for questions. Operator?

================================================================================
q-and-a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) David Amsellem, Piper Sandler.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Amsellem, Piper Sandler & Co. - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, thanks. So just have a few questions. First, can you talk about how you're thinking about the commercial organization going forward with the pivot to neuropsychiatry and what that means in terms of headcount, what that means in terms of your existing pain specialist focused sales organization? Is that organizations something you're going to sort of used to focus to reallocate resources and focus on psychiatrist. So maybe help us understand how you're thinking about that going forward.
And secondly, I wanted to ask you about exclusivity runway here. I think you mentioned in the press release that Orange Book patents go to 2032. But I'm just wondering just are there other barriers here to potential generics that we should be mindful of such as the nature of the formulation, having delayed and extended release properties? And also just the fact that it's a schedule to just help us better understand how you're thinking about the exclusivity runway with those ideas in mind?
And then lastly, what's the mix between [ped] and adults in terms of usage of the product and how you think that's going to evolve over time. I know that's a mouthful, but I'll stop there. Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, David. I'm going to turn to Scott for the first part of the question on the commercial organization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Dreyer, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, David. Yeah, great question, David. Look, the key thing I would say it's not a pivot, it's an expansion. So we will maintain 100% focused on the pain portfolio, that sales team will be fully intact. They will continue to sell those products and drive that almost $600 million business. Separately, we will bring in the full Ironshore sales team and they will be focused 100% on Jornay PM. So that's how we view these. It's an expansion of Collegium into a new therapeutic area, but both businesses are critically important and will be funded as such.
I could also ask answer the ped-adult mix since you asked that question. When it comes to prescriptions, it's used significantly towards paediatrics are north of 80%, and we'll see as we get going what the opportunity is on the adult side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks, Scott. And I'll answer the question for you on exclusivity. As we mentioned, we have the product Jornay PM has 16 Orange Book-listed patents, which expire in 2032. We'll obviously continue to look at other opportunities going forward for expanded exclusivity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Amsellem, Piper Sandler & Co. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.

Tim Lugo, William Blair.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, this is John on for Tim. Congrats on the deal, and thanks so much for taking our questions. Maybe just two from us. First, could you give us some more color on how we should be thinking about how this deal will impact your incremental spend over the next few years?
And second, could you maybe give us some color on how you're thinking about prioritizing the deal versus continuing to repurchase shares? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I will turn the call. Thanks you for the question to Colleen for the first part of the question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks John, for the question. Appreciate that. So what I would say now is we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive and significantly accretive in 2025. We would look forward to providing you more specifics around guidance and what our operating expense levels will be in the normal course, which we do in early January. So we'll update you post-close.
On the capital allocation, I would say our top priority is getting this transaction closed and maximizing the potential of Jornay. And then also we will continue to pay down debt and opportunistically return capital via the share repurchase program.

Serge Belanger, Needham & Company.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serge Belanger, Needham & Company LLC - Senior Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Good morning. I also want to offer my congrats on the transaction. I guess two questions. First one, can you talk about the sales effort that was behind the product at Ironshore and whether that will change once it transitions over to Collegium.
And then secondly, this is probably for Scott, you talked about 80% coverage. Just wondering if there's any more work to be done on that front, you expect additional coverage or even on a prior off what that currently looks like and if it can be improved? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Scott, why don't you take both those questions? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Dreyer, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, no problem. So first and foremost, right now, the Ironshore team has a field operation that's about 133 representatives. They've done a phenomenal job. When I mentioned the script growth, 58% script growth year over year last year, 32% year to date this year, right. So we will bring that whole team over. And then we'll always like we do with our current portfolio, be evaluating the opportunity. And if we need more and ensuring that we fully cover the market to reach the full potential.
When it comes to the coverage, I think there's a couple of key things, Serge. 80% overall coverage, again that 60% commercial and 40% Medicaid. As we do with our pain portfolio, will always be looking to get the best coverage we possibly can and will be taking on -- in and as we get the product. But a couple of important things of note, as you think about it compared to our pain portfolio, there's no Medicare Part D business. So some of the kind of baggage that comes with the evolution of Medicare Part D. There's none of that there. That also helps with price in Medicare because there's not as much discounting to drive coverage for the actual brand.
So there's some good things, but we'll be digging in further. But the main point I'd say is, look, it's great coverage right now, it's at a great point, and the team is doing a great job leveraging that to drive growth so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glen Santangelo, Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. I have financial question on a high level one. So Colleen, maybe let me start with you. I know you kind of gave us this in the prepared remarks a little bit, but could you give us a little bit more in terms of how much cash you plan to use off the balance sheet and how much you're wrapping into this term loan and what the rate is on that specifically, what is the rate on that term loan? Because I'm trying to just reconcile all these comments with the view that you think it's going to be immediately accretive to EBITDA. So any sort of those pieces would be helpful.
And then I have a follow-up question.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the question, Glen. So the term loan of $646 million it takes out or replaces our existing term loan with a remaining balance of about $321 million. So as you think about the totality of the new term, it's about half to use for this acquisition and have to replace our existing note
The interest rate, which we're very pleased with is sulfur plus 450. And as we think about accretion, yeah, we're expecting immediate accretion on an adjusted EBITDA basis significant cost of capital savings with that 300 basis points reduction to our existing interest rates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glen Santangelo, Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, perfect. That's helpful. Hey, Mike, maybe if I could just follow up with you. I mean the obvious question is right that you're doing this deal only a couple of months after a sort of sudden CTO departure. And so it makes us wonder if you're playing devil's advocate for a second. What are the biggest risks you see related to the transaction? I mean when you look at sort of the revenue runway. Question came in about the competitive landscape as a safety or efficacy related? Like sort of what are some of the concerns you had to consider when looking at this transaction? Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. I mean, I think the strategy, the business development strategy has been pretty straightforward and well-articulated over time and interesting enough, we've continued to look at assets that had a very specific criteria and that criteria was really commercial based assets. That were highly differentiated, had significant revenue growth potential, and durable revenue with exclusivity into the 2030s and really allowed us to leverage our commercial core competencies as well as our experience in integrating commercial assets. This self-square in that, it opportunistically came our way and it was the right deal at the right time for Collegium.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glen Santangelo, Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you been looking at it for a while, or is this something that just suddenly came up?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've been looking at this as we look at all assets over time. We have been aware of this, but we actively got involved in the process recently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glen Santangelo, Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you.

Les Sulewski, Truist Securities - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning and congrats on the transaction guys. Just quickly on the drug delivery system, is this unique to Ironshore? Can this platform be repurposed? And are you aware of any other nighttime treatments for ADHD in development now? And I have a follow-up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott, you want to take that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Dreyer, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. So good question in terms of use of the technology in other places. I'm not going to comment on that. We're right now the focus is Jornay, but it is unique, right? It is the only product that is dosed in the evening for ADHD. The key is what that leads to like. Why is that evening dosing important?
And that's because it eliminates the need to dose at school or work or throughout the day. It provides a smooth, the technology allows for kind of a smooth onset upon awakening and then control throughout the day. And it has five doses. So those five doses allow for flexibility by the physician when treating the patient, to kind of manage the onset and the duration of effect. So that all is unique to this asset and is what excites us about it, and there's nothing meaningfully on the horizon in the competitive set for years to come.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Les Sulewski, Truist Securities - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Thank you. Can you just comment if at all, what does the margin profile versus your current portfolio and then any royalties owed to or by Ironshore? Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen, do you want to take that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, absolutely. So I'll just give you a general answer. So from a margin profile perspective, high margin product, we will provide more inflammation post-close. And -- when we provide you with 2025 guidance. And yes, there is a single digit royalty associated with the asset.

Oren Livnat, H.C. Wainwright.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Livnat, H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. I have a couple. Just to build on your high-level comments about maximizing the value of Jornay. Can you just talk about what capabilities or resources you bring to the table that maybe we're not available yet at Ironshore, and are you comfortable talking about the peak potential. Are the bookends on peak potential for this product. I know when you talked about your [BD] strategy always talked about $150 million revenue potential. I think, for example, with a product you like?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. Thank you, Oren for your question. Scott, you want to take the first one?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Dreyer, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, great. Yeah, thanks, Oren. In terms of building on the capabilities, I think first and foremost, it's our established capabilities, relationships, and market access relationships, and what we've proven from an overall commercial capabilities applied to pain.
I think the other thing that we bring to the table is due to the strength of our pain business and the significant cash generation, we are absolutely able to fully invest to maximize journey, and that's what we're going to be focused on doing.
Colleen, do you want to speak to?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I won't provide anything on peak sales at this point in time. What I would say is really there is a strong revenue base. We expect full year 2024 sales to be in excess of $100 million. Scott spoke specifically about a really robust year-over-year prescription growth in 2023 in the first half of 2024. And we'll look forward to providing you an update on guidance in the coming months post-close.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Livnat, H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And I think maybe David touching us upfront about any changes to the existing business. And I think you said steady as she goes on that front. But can you just talk about now that growth, this is a higher growth market and with a longer, at least a longer certain runway that we can look at for this franchise versus the pain well if the -- sum of the pain business.
So will you be -- I guess when to think about the priorities and where the investment is in this business going forward? Are you getting more focused on this new neurocytes unit and perhaps when you think about business development more on that front and just leveraging that business and will you I guess, spend less be more explicit on the pain side. And I have one last question after that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, I'll take that one. This -- the pain business is a very important business to Collegium. It's a major cash generator. It's a growth business. It's a stable business. It's a durable business and that will remain as important and high priority as it always has been.
The new opportunity really allows us the growth opportunity to be a significant growth driver that maybe we didn't necessarily have in our pain business at this point in time. And we will look to build out a therapeutic expertise in the new category, neuropsychiatry. Similar to the way we've built expertise in the pain market. So that is the goal going forward. And this really provides us the opportunity as a beachhead for that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Livnat, H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. And just lastly also know you talking about IP to 2032. I guess no specific comment on the formulation to science and whether there's other barriers, but I guess explicitly, are there already any generic filers, P4 or otherwise on this product?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Heffernan, Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc(Pre-Merger) - President, Chief Executive Officer, Founder    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there are no current P4 filers at this time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Livnat, H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. Thanks so much. I look forward to following up after.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the conference calls upon which Summaries are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.
