--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Stephanie, and thank you to everyone participating today. I am on Slide 4. Last week, we were very pleased to announce the acquisition of IRISYS, a San Diego-based CDMO with capabilities that greatly complement our own. While our 2 latest quarters have demonstrated a significant strengthening of Recro's business and a clear path to organic growth, this acquisition offered a unique opportunity to accelerate our momentum. 
We believe that through the joining of these 2 companies, we have created an organization best positioned to achieve Recro's 4-pronged strategy for growth, which includes: Strengthening the organization through leadership and talent; expanding and diversify our customer base; strengthening the company's financial status; and enhancing our capabilities and competencies. The acquisition of IRISYS contributes to each of these goals, and we are very pleased to add its team, its expertise and services to the Recro brand.
Looking at Slide 5. This transaction brings together 2 synergistic organizations to create a full-service CDMO with a significantly broader service offering and a greater opportunity for growth. In evaluating this transaction, we were compelled by a number of important factors, including: Increased pipeline and revenue diversification; expanded capabilities beyond oral solid dose, including sterile injectables and other advanced dosage forms; the ability to leverage a variety of functional capabilities across a wider footprint; synergies within business development, clinical development and commercial scale up; a bicoastal presence and increased talent pool; and an expanded global customer base; a strong alignment and contribution to our already strong culture; and multiple platforms for future organic growth. 
Specifically, and as outlined on Slide 6, by acquiring IRISYS, Recro is gaining a business that has over 3 dozen customers; has produced clinical trial materials for more than 100 drugs, including 4 commercial or near-commercial products; has a full year 2021 estimated revenue of $15.4 million, with an estimated full year 2021 EBITDA of $2.8 million; has a contracted backlog and vetted sales pipeline of $23.4 million; and an 85% repeat business rate with its existing customers, servicing those customers from 6 countries. And most importantly, Recro can now offer capabilities beyond oral solid dose, including sterile and non-sterile injectables, liquid and powder field capsules, tablets, oral liquids, topical formulations and ophthalmic droppers. 
Slide 7 outlines details of the transaction wherein we acquired 100% of IRISYS for an enterprise value of approximately $50 million. The purchase price was paid through $25.5 million of cash at closing, 9,302,718 shares of common stock of Recro to be issued in 6 months and a seller's promissory note of $6.1 million. The seller note has a 3-year maturity date from the date of closing and bears interest at a rate of 6% annually. 
As illustrated on Slide 8, this transaction will directly impact Recro's goal of upgrading and expanding our facilities and capabilities. As you can see here, the joining of these 2 companies has created a significantly broader service platform. 
Beyond our facilities and capabilities and as depicted on Slide 9, we believe this acquisition will also contribute significantly to each area of our 4-pronged strategy. We believe it will strengthen leadership and the overall organization through the addition of strong scientific talent and access to West Coast customers and human capital. 
If you look at Slides 12 through 22 in sequence, you can see the progression of Recro's customer diversification, both organically through Slide 16, where we've made good progress and then the immediate impact on customer diversification and a resultant reduction in dependency risk as we add the IRISYS pipeline to our portfolio, beginning on Slide 18. 
This acquisition will expand and diversify our customer base, resulting in a shift in our commercial versus clinical mix from 90%, 10% to approximately 75%, 25% and increase diversification from oral solid dose to a balance of advanced dosage forms and OSD and a California presence that we believe will significantly increase the opportunity to access and win new West Coast customers. And it will strengthen the company's financial status through and increased EBITDA, which is beneficial to our debt covenants and an extension of the due date, which improves cash flow. 
In closing, and as highlighted on Slide 23, through the acquisition of IRISYS, Recro has significantly enhanced the company's capabilities and competencies and created a path for substantial growth. We are thrilled to have successfully executed this important transaction which has truly transformed Recro overnight into a bicoastal business with a much larger customer base and service offering. 
Today, Recro is a new and optimized organization and we believe we now have all the established infrastructure and talent required to achieve future organic growth. I wish to welcome everyone at IRISYS to the Recro team, and look forward to working with each of you as we advance our mission of helping improve patient lives through our client partnerships. 
This concludes my prepared remarks for today. We can now open up the call for questions. Operator?


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) We have a question from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Gregory Hewitt,  Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking the questions and for providing the incremental details on this acquisition. I had a chance to go through the slide deck and thank you for the details there. But I'm curious if you could provide a little bit more on the customer expansion opportunities through this acquisition and what that will provide from a diversification standpoint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Matt. David Enloe, and I'll respond to that. Thanks for the question. As we show here, what we wanted to try to transparently share with everybody is the good work that the core business has already done and performed on our oral solid dose business. So starting in Slide 12, you can see where essentially, we started in 2017 with a few projects, essentially all of them later-stage projects. And then as you see, what happens in '18 and now into 2021 on the next 2 slides, you can see very successful diversification as we've added programs one by one. 
And so we've been announcing those as best we can, and hopefully, folks following us can appreciate what we're doing to reduce our dependency risk there. We then go pro forma and these are estimates, and these are based on what we know today. And they're for illustrative purposes in terms of size and scope they're relative to one another, but you can see what we believe to be a reasonable forecast to expect in '23 and '25 on the next 2 slides -- of Slides 15 and 16, excuse me. So you can see that our core business is being diversified and therefore, we're reducing our customer dependency risk. 
But then if you skip to Slide 18, immediately with the red balls, you can start to see what happens when you throw IRISYS's portfolio on top of the legacy portfolio of Recro. And so obviously, you see a very different type of mix. And then as you scroll through '18 and then to -- excuse me, Slide 18, not 2018. So Slide 18 and then Slides 19 and 20, you can see where we end up with a much broader portfolio spread across the product life cycle and our plant, our dependency risk is greatly reduced. 
A different way to look at it is in Slide 21 and 22, which basically looks at the new business pipeline that the base business of Recro has. And then you can overlay on Slide 22, the new business pipeline phase that the legacy IRISYS acquisition brings. And again, a much more diverse portfolio and very representative of what we would like to see our business look like as we go forward. So we're very excited about this element of the acquisition, and we look forward to executing as we go forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Gregory Hewitt,  Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's very helpful. Maybe a couple of follow-ups and then I'll hop back in the queue. But first off, I realize it's very early days, but have you had any opportunity to speak with some of IRISYS's customers? And what is the feedback been from them? Or do you see cross-selling opportunities?
And then maybe -- I'm not sure if this was mentioned in the 8-K or something. But where does IRISYS's facilities sit from a capacity standpoint? How much excess capacity is there as you look to grow that business over the coming years? Is there -- do you have room to grow there? Or will that require some incremental investment in the coming years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Good question. So I'm at what I'll call Recro San Diego offices every day right now. I have definitely interacted with a couple of key customers already and have meetings set up with others already as well. And as importantly, and perhaps more, our business development team is already linking into the legacy IRISYS business, understanding those capabilities and beginning to communicate those across a broader customer base. And so we wasted no time whatsoever in carrying out those important activities.
I also would take the opportunity to say it's not just in the business development that we're talking. It's also in the regulatory front, on the quality front and really, the total interaction that we can bring as a larger, more commercially-minded historically company. And so Recro will definitely be able to bring maturation to those important processes that are part of making us a successful partner going forward.
From a capacity perspective, I would consider the facility, not unlike the Recro Gainesville development facility, the so-called Chestnut facility, both in size, in style. And it's further along because of the number of years it's been operating. But there is a lot of capacity left. We think that it's operating right now at about 25% to 35% capacity. So there's a lot of capacity built in. We don't have large incremental CapEx requirements going forward to scale the business up, which is very promising. 
And also, very importantly, the new sterile injectable fill line for vial filling and then lyophilization, it has just come online. And so that represents great upside as we go forward and begin to sell into that service offering, which is a very high rate of growth element of the business right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jacob K. Johnson,  Stephens Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David, maybe on the last point. I mean the press release gives a number of capabilities that the deal brings to you guys now. Can you just talk about maybe of those offerings that IRISYS has, what was kind of most coveted by you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jacob, I think the thing that -- coveted. So the most attractive element to me was the fact that no single form of dosage formulation is dominant in that offering, but it's very nicely spread out. So again, as we look towards the word of the day, diversification, we're not just bringing something that is very heavily bent towards 1 element of that diversification, but really adding all the way across that.
I'll say that within the small molecule space, the higher growing compounded annual growth rate areas are certainly in the sterile injectable space. And the fact that there is a brand-new, well-equipped, ready-to-operate fill line and importantly also a lyophilizer freeze-drier set to launch was a very important part of our decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jacob K. Johnson,  Stephens Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. That's super helpful. And then I understand you're not updating guidance yet for the deal. You've given us 2021 numbers, which means inevitably, we're going to ask about 2022, which you're probably also not going to give. But maybe the question is this, can you just talk about how -- what revenue growth has looked at -- looked like at IRISYS over the last couple of years and maybe how we should think about, I think, $15 million in revenues this year, the $23 million in backlog, how that could -- that backlog could play out over the near term, if possible?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. I'll turn that question over to Ryan, and I'm going to pile on to the back end of it -- of his answer, if it's okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan D. Lake,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jacob. So from a historical financial perspective, the IRISYS business has continued to grow and expand from really $8 million to $10 million to $12 million to $15 million in revenue this year. So over the past couple of years, it represents about a 50% revenue growth and an EBITDA growth in the 75% range. 
So the business has been growing. They've been investing in the business as well to support that growth. Their EBITDA margins have been in the high teens. So there is a lot of visibility to their current core business, I think roughly 75% of their current business comes from their clinical development programs and 85% of that business is repeat business, and they've really grown their customers pretty exponentially from 10 to nearly 40 today. So it does give us confidence into next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Christine Rains with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christine Rains,   -     [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the acquisition. I just wanted to ask about the 4 products that IRISYS has that are in the commercial side or close to commercial. If you could describe those products a little bit more, how they're growing and maybe what therapeutic area is they're in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Christine. And I'll -- Ryan, if you don't mind sharing some of the detail there. And if there's something I need to add, I'll do so at the end of your answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan D. Lake,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Christine. So that there's 2 near-term commercial products. Certainly, those will be dependent on their clinical pathway and regulatory approval. Their current existing commercial products, one of their largest customers represents approximately 20% of their overall revenue. And they have contracted backlog through -- their contracted with them through the beginning of 2025. And there's also annual minimum purchase requirements under that agreement. So that's the most significant of the 4 right now. That particular dosage form areas and liquids as well as tablets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Christine, I would just add that one of the other near-term commercial is a different formulation of sort of a gel. So again, further diversity of offering and portfolio spread.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christine Rains,   -     [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's really helpful. And then just 1 more on my -- and if you could just talk about the sort of synergies you expect post-closing either on the operational or sales and marketing or even if there's any client overlap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I'm happy to do that. This is David. There's a lot of opportunity for business synergies. And the fact that the -- part of the acquisition that really makes us the most excited is that Recro's legacy is that of a robust commercial scale manufacturer with all of the mindsets, protocols and means of operating on a day-to-day basis that, that implies. 
And so as the IRISYS pipeline matures and gets more and more up into the Phase III and the near commercial product launch sort of work, that organization, which is very natural with most CDMOs, the Recro experience is kind of the reverse of what is normal. The organization is going to have to mature and grow with that product portfolio. We can bring that to bear on day 1. And so already, we see a lot of synergy with respect to quality, with respect to regulatory consultation, advice, filing, pre-IND meetings, PAI meetings. Even both facilities operate under DEA licensure, and we're able to provide support across that footprint now in a very robust way.
There are operational excellence best practices that can be put into place, environmental health safety. Really across the entire organization, there are synergies. But then the biggest one is the business development, sales and marketing area, where we're really retooling, as you've read over the past year, our entire business development approach and team. And they're very excited about now being able to also approach our customer base, which is much broader now, and talk about with them a multitude of solutions that we can provide, which becomes very important as the market continues to seek out more full-service CDMOs who can offer more than 1 solution. 
So it's been very important for us to be in the oral solid dose state area of the market, but it's even more important for us to be operating and providing offerings across the totality of dosage forms. So I hope I answered your question thoroughly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A for today. I would like to turn the call back to David Enloe for his final remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J. David Enloe,  Recro Pharma, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So that last question almost was my final remarks, but I'll just reiterate how excited we are to have the IRISYS team join Recro. Our cultures while similar, are going to be additive and complementary to each other, so I really look forward to seeing what we can accomplish as a combined team. We -- we're very happy, and the last slide or Slide 23 emphasizes these points, to see an expanded pipeline revenue diversification, now locations both on the East and West Coast, so we can access the deep customer base and the talent pool out on the West Coast. 
The synergies I just spoke about, enhanced capabilities and our ability to cross-sell services across our existing customer bases on both sides is very compelling. And the financial side is supportive of who we want to be as we continue to grow and improve our business.
So thank you, everybody, for their time today to participate in this call and in the future, listening to the recording. And we look forward to building a stronger enterprise. Thank you.
