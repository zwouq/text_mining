--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today marks a momentous occasion for our company. First, we have found an excellent home for our business and colleagues who devoted themselves to our manufacturing and commercialization of the legacy brands in our company. Alora is a terrific partner due to their dedication to branded generic and contract manufacturing products. And I want to congratulate Art Deas for his leadership and his team in this process. This transaction represents a major advance in our strategic process announced last November, and it allows the company to be entirely focused on building the franchise in ocular medicine and aesthetics. 
Since we launched Upneeq late last year, we have seen steady increases in new prescriptions, and we're now at a full complement of over 100 sales representatives fully trained on board in the field and many of them with outstanding backgrounds in eye care. We intend to roll out our buy-and-bill strategy to eye care professionals in the third quarter and in the first quarter of '22 plan to launch into the aesthetic marketplace. 
It should be noted that we also retain all rights to arbaclofen, and we plan to submit a new protocol to the FDA under a special protocol assessment in the month of July. We are thrilled that we can now turn all of our energy and thoughts behind driving Upneeq, which is truly a one-of-a-kind asset that we have the utmost confidence in our ability to grow it. So with that, I'll give it a pause and open it for questions, and JD and Andrew are with me, and we're happy to take all questions. Thank you.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Greg Fraser from Truist Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on the deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A couple of financial questions. How do we think about the pro forma operating expense base? And can you expand on how much of the proceeds you plan to deploy towards paying down debt versus increasing behind Upneeq?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Great. Good question, and thank you. We plan to put the vast majority of the proceeds behind paying down our existing term loans. And we have negotiated a stub period with our current lending group that gives us more than sufficient time to bring down new financing. And we are in multiple conversations with blue-chip firms to lend into or provide financing into the launch of this great asset. Andy, anything you want to add to that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew J. Einhorn,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, Brian. The operating expense base will be concentrated on promotional activities for supporting Upneeq. That includes the sales, marketing, pharmacy costs and other expenses. And that is -- we'll be basically allowed to focus the entire company's infrastructure on that asset and to grow that asset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Okay. Can you help with the triggers for the milestone payments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're not disclosing those at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then I know -- well, on Upneeq, I know it's not the primary focus of the call, but curious if you can comment on prescription demand in May and maybe so far in June? And can you expand on your plans to launch into the aesthetics market early next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is the best question of the morning. And JD, I'll let you roll on this one, okay?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James D. Schaub,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Executive VP & COO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thanks, Greg. So look, I think Brian touched on it in his upfront comments. We continue to see strong growth coming out of our efforts in the eye care space. In the second quarter, we're near the end now. I think it's safe to say we're going to come out of the second quarter almost 2x growth in prescriptions from the first quarter, probably right around 9,000 prescriptions in the second quarter alone. We continue to see strong increases in new prescribers every day and every week. That's been consistent with past comments and quarterly updates, Greg, continuing to see 40 to 50 new prescribers every day. 
So the excitement and the enthusiasm and the momentum do not seem to be slowing down. And I think that speaks to the confidence we have in what we're doing and how we're going about building this market. A couple other kind of data points that we talk about that I think are relevant. We've been able to expand our reach to just about 11,000 eye care providers launched to date. So again, a consistent increase in the reach as we've continued to grow and expand the field force as well. 
And I think in line with building this market and the continuum of acquired ptosis from mild through severe, we've now seen a market drop from launch in the average age of our patients coming in, which I think speaks to this transformation in terms of what acquired ptosis is and starting to shift that prescribing behavior and continuum beyond just that severe patient that walks in and is overtly noticeable into the more moderate and ultimately mild forms of acquired ptosis. 
So for reference, I think, in September, October, we were in the upper 60s from an average age. And coming out of the second quarter, I think the average age of patients we're seeing is 60. So that continues to trend in the right direction as well. And look, there's a lot to be excited about as we make this transition into a pure-play ocular aesthetics business. I think the second part of your question was the aesthetic rollout, and I'll throw it back to Brian and then happy to pile in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So we are building our KOL group through the latter half of the summer into the fall. We have hired an outstanding candidate to help us lead our aesthetic entry, and we'll be disclosing his name shortly after the 4th of July. And our plan is to build a team out that's modestly different than eye care and launch straight into the aesthetic market with the buy-and-bill program, much like all the other aesthetic agents in the first quarter of next year. 
And I think to just circle back for a moment on the company, we will be an extremely focused and streamlined commercial and medical engine around building ocular aesthetics. So the diversity in our company as it looks today from end-to-end manufacturing, distribution, et cetera, will now become far more streamlined around a magnificent growth asset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question comes from David Steinberg from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Michael Steinberg,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Specialty Pharma Analyst & Equity Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a couple of questions. I know that, initially, you've had a limited controlled or a limited rollout, and you've offered the drug to a relatively small subset of physicians to allow them to have some experiences with the drug.  Curious what kind of feedback are you getting from the doctors? 
Secondly, have you decided on the commercialization strategy in terms of buy and bill versus other types of strategic initiatives? And it would seem to me this would be the type of product that you want to have a direct-to-consumer advertising program for. Do you have anything in the budget for that? And what sort of campaign will you be running?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, David. It's nice to see you up early in the morning. There were a lot of questions there. So I'm going to start and then let JD fill in. But first, on the initial distribution of our product, the number of samples out there. We had quite a few because remember, and I think it's important for everyone to keep in mind, we launched into a market where there are no analogs. So we're building a market. 
The other thing is when you come out of clinical research and into the general population, you really want to understand better what general use will look like. And in short order, what we learned from physician survey and interaction and also from the patients themselves from their early reports has been that the product is performing better than we had ever hoped. Physicians love it, the patients love it. For some patients with ptosis that affects not only their visual field but their appearance that benefit from this product, we are hearing things like, "I'm the old me again." Many of them are even brought to tears over how well this can work for them. 
So bottom line on the product performance, couldn't be better than we thought. So that's great on that front. And we still have a lot of samples to work through and get the formula right for samples to first time prescribing. So secondly, into aesthetics, I believe that was the next stage of your question. We'll be introducing buy and bill to eye care, not dissimilar to how the contact lens models are working today. We're going to give particularly optometry the opportunity to be a partner with us as they partner with the patient and bring this to everyone. And JD, I've got a little bit of interference at the airport. Why don't you finish up with it, and then I'll come back here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James D. Schaub,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Executive VP & COO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So David, I think to close the loop on the distribution, the buy and bill is going to roll out in the third quarter, probably the latter part of the third quarter for eye care. And we're obviously excited about the prospects of being able where we're allowed the direct point of sale and prescription to be in the office. I think Brian's comments about how quickly this product works and the impact that it has, that's a tremendous opportunity to continue to bring excitement and visibility into the office, but also access at the point of care as well. 
I think from a consumer perspective, you're going to continue to see, as we move into the back half of the year, an increased digital presence from a consumer standpoint. So everything from programmatic and advertising, paid search, which has been really tremendous as we've piloted in the second quarter, a really, really tremendous driver of impressions and visits and follow-up information. So we're seeing a lot of the things that not just in the field but from a traditional marketing tactic perspective that really speak to the increasing investment and range of tactics that we're continuing to build and put behind this asset as we once again build a market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Michael Steinberg,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Specialty Pharma Analyst & Equity Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Just have a couple of follow-up questions, JD and Brian. It's a cash pay product. Do you think you -- after a couple of quarters on the market, do you think you've priced it correctly? Or do you think you're leaving some money on the table? Do you have any sense of how many prescriptions, let's just say, the 1-month supply versus the 3, do you think -- are patients using it all up in a month? Or might it take 2 months to use up 1-month supply? And so what I'm getting at is how many units would you think patients will use per year? 
And then finally, in thinking about your P&L going forward as a stand-alone ophthalmic company, what sort of R&D are you going to have? Are you going to have any R&D? You mentioned you have 100 reps to optimize the commercialization strategy. How many reps do you think you'll need? And then what sort of -- related to that is what sort of cost structure do you think you need to break even on the P&L?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right, David. So I'll start, JD, and David, thanks again for 30 questions in one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Michael Steinberg,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Specialty Pharma Analyst & Equity Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will continue to invest in R&D. We already have a #2 advanced follow-on formulations for Upneeq that could be even improved over the current formulation and they're in development right now. But our R&D budget, as you would think about it compared to what it is today prior to the divestiture, will be significantly reduced and streamlined. And we'll be able to give much more guidance in the future once we close on the transaction and understand the interaction between our company and Alora going forward as we help them with transition services and also they need to help us a little bit as well. So there's a bit of crossover for a while. 
First of all, going all the way back to the pricing question, it feels like we're at the right price. And the reason I say that is it is our pharmacy -- our pharmacists and our pharmacy techs that are talking to the patients, that are filling prescriptions. And yes, we are getting pushback by some on pricing. That's clear. But it's not really a big part of the story. I think most of the reason that we're not getting scripts filled could be attributed to a cross-section of some patients can't be reached right away. Some people, for the most part, have samples, and they want to run through their samples before they get the fill. But pricing is really not the headline. And more importantly, we did extensive third-party market research, and we view that the current price is actually in the right zone, which also allows us to put margin in the hands of those physicians that participate in a value share buy-and-bill program without arbitraging our price and our MSRP than what we would recommend. And -- so we could certainly speak further on that. And then JD, you want to pop over to the rest of the questions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James D. Schaub,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Executive VP & COO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I think, David, the other component of your question was around refills and what are we seeing in terms of persistency.  We obviously spend a lot of time looking at this. We think it's an important value driver from an exponential standpoint in terms of how this product builds and grows over time. We're encouraged. And I think it's still early to put a stake in the ground in terms of what is that average persistency over the course of a 12-month period per patient. But if we look back at a cohort where we've got, call it, 9 months of data or so, so going back to patients that started in September or October, we're right around 4 months of therapy on average, so 120 vials per patient through 9 months. 
So I think very encouraging, probably a bit higher than we otherwise would have projected internally out of the gate. And I think a lot of reasons to believe that we can continue to focus on driving that number even higher as we go and build over time as well. So hopefully, that gets at the breadth of your questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Michael Steinberg,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Specialty Pharma Analyst & Equity Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it does. Appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question comes from Daniel Busby from RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel James Busby,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Assistant VP    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats, guys, on the deal. A couple of questions. First...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel James Busby,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Assistant VP    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you talk about your strategy to reach the remaining 40,000 or so eye care professionals over the next few years? It sounds like you've kind of interacted with 11,000 already, but that still leaves a pretty big chunk out there. Should we expect further expansion of your sales force over time? Or is that perhaps a role for a co-promotion partner to reach some of the lower decile ECPs?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, great question. And we debate internally now quite a bit about whether to add more to the team in the field. And the answer right now is we're good at our number of just over 100. And the reason is that our reach is very good. We believe that we'll be over -- well over 17,000 physicians sampled and prescribing by the middle of next year. And our targeting is getting very good, and we're not sending people into white space because our key demographic is driven by a certain level of household income and population dynamics. 
So if we had more than 100 reps right now, you would see more prescriptions, that's clear but -- because this drug is so promotionally responsive. But I believe that we need to test our reach and depth strategy a little bit further before we can consider adding more reps. The ROI is there, the growth is there. And more reps is more prescriptions. But the question for us is the right level of growth, what steady state in terms of the team. And again, maybe the most important thing is we have no competition. We own the space. We're building the market. So more reps would drive more prescriptions, but I'm not at a point yet where I want to walk down that road because I think we're seeing a lot of really strong growth and reach as it is. JD, you want to add to that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James D. Schaub,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Executive VP & COO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. I think in the interim, too, the ability to get to more ECPs beyond the boots on the ground and the team that is in place today, look, as we continue to add to things like state sponsorships where we're going in and participating at more of a micro level, supporting education and awareness within different state optometric associations, virtual education and webinars, I think we have plans to build an inside sales and customer service team that will be able to further support outreach into white space in response to inbounds from doctors that we just have not yet been able to get in front of. Those are some other ways that we can supplement beyond what is a really solid footprint and reach from a sales team perspective as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I think -- yes, one final note, sorry to interrupt. But obviously, the world is going digital, and we need to see the returns from our digital progress and our build-out as another means of supplementing what would be a traditional model. There's no replacement for some of the traditional model, but the world is changing. We've got a lot of things in development right now around telemedicine that are not ready for prime time. And our digital campaign, as JD mentioned, is just getting off the ground. So there's a lot of growth to be had through possibly more efficient means, and we're fully going to explore that before we continue to lay on infrastructure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel James Busby,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Assistant VP    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just a big picture question. Now that you'll be a more streamlined company, less debt, more focused, does that change the way you think about business development and potentially layering on additional products, whether in ophthalmology or aesthetics? And again, maybe not right away, but as we think about the strategic direction of the company over the next, say, 2, 3, 4, 5 years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
100%. It makes the business development mission crystal clear. We will have a franchise in eye care and aesthetics, 2 commercial platforms buttressed by a self-made distribution fulfillment center in pharmacy, and we're a cash pay business, no insurance. So as new products come into the field, whether it's eye care or aesthetics, we're going to be very picky about who we let into the club and what we go after. And you can imagine one product in addition on this channel turbocharges the entire business. So there's a lot of good candidates that we have our eyes on. But I think as Andy would say, let's focus on our knitting right in front of us today, but the business development landscape for us has just become crystal clear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And there are no further questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian A. Markison,  Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc - Chairman, President & CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Operator, if there are no more questions, we want to thank everybody for listening in. And all I would say is we're in for a great ride. Also, best of luck to Alora. What a fantastic team to work with, and thank you all for joining us today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.
