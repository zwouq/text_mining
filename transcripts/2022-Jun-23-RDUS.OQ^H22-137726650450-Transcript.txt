Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Radius Health Inc. conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker host, Ethan Holdaway, Head of Investor Relations.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. A press release in connection with the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone of our safe harbor and that this call will include forward-looking statements. Our most recently filed 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements represent our views as of today only. 
The tender offer or the offer for the outstanding shares -- the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, the company referenced in the press release and on this call has not yet commenced. This call is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities, nor is it a substitute for the tender offer materials that Ginger Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation or the parent, and Ginger Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of parent or the purchaser, will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, upon commencement of the offer. At the time the offer is commenced, parent and purchaser will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO, and thereafter, the company will file a solicitation or recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC with respect to the offer. 
The tender offer materials, including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and certain other tender offer documents and the solicitation or recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 will contain important information. The company's stockholders are urged to read these documents carefully when they become available as each may be amended or supplemented from time to time because they will contain important information that holders of the company's securities should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their securities. Holders of shares can obtain these documents when they are filed and become available free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the company's website at www.radiuspharm.com. 
Joining with me on the call is Owen Hughes, Chairman of the Board; and Kelly Martin, President and CEO, who will provide an overview of the announced transaction. I would now like to turn it over to Owen.

Owen P. Hughes,  Radius Health, Inc. - Independent Chairman    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Ethan. Good morning, everyone, and we appreciate you dialing in. We're pleased to be here today to announce the transaction, and more importantly, why we believe this is a positive outcome for our shareholders and stakeholders. With respect to today's call, both Kelly Martin, CEO and myself will provide some background on the transaction. We will, however, not be taking questions this morning as we have been advised to wait until the merger documents have been filed and the details of the lengthy process have been made public before we engage in the specifics. Once that has transpired, we'll be pleased to engage with all shareholders and all analysts directly. 
So this morning, we announced an agreement to be acquired by Gurnet Point Capital, a private investment firm focused on the health care and life sciences sectors as well as Patient Square Capital, a leading dedicated health care investment firm. This transaction has been unanimously approved by the Radius Board. 
With respect to details, potential per share value totals $11 per share, including $10 cash paid at closing and a potential $1 CVR payable upon TYMLOS net sales reaching $300 million during any 12-month period prior to December 31, 2025. The total transaction value is equivalent to $890 million. Importantly, this transaction is a culmination of a thorough and rigorous strategic review that was conducted over 9 months by the Board and management with the assistance of external advisers and included each of the assets that are currently in the Radius portfolio. This review included outreach to and interactions with multiple strategic parties and a number of financial sponsors on all parts of our business. We are confident that this transaction delivers immediate value and liquidity to Radius shareholders in the context of a volatile market and specifically a volatile biotech market and provides the clearest path forward for Radius. 
The cash upfront payment at closing represents a premium of 45% over the 30-day VWAP of Radius' common stock, and inclusive of the CVR, the premium would reach 59%. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022. 
The teams at both Gurnet Point and Patient Square consists of highly experienced industry executives that work closely with its portfolio companies with an active approach to drive operational transformation and outsized returns. We look forward to working closely with the GPC and PSC team members and moving Radius forward for our patients. And with that, allow me to turn it over to Kelly, our CEO. Kelly?

G. Kelly Martin,  Radius Health, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Owen. And I'll just have a few brief comments that complement or supplement Owen's very clear outline. Number one, and just to repeat, this outcome is the culmination of at least 9 months worth of review by both the Board, the management and outside advisers. And to emphasize, in particular, Owen's statements that the review and assessment included all of the assets, of which we have 3 main assets, as many people know. Abaloparatide,both from a U.S. perspective and a non-U.S. perspective, elacestrant, and last but certainly not least, is RAD011. We had significant discussions, which will be evident, as Owen said, when the merger documents are made public. 
Second point I'd like to highlight, as mentioned in the press release, we have approximately 250 employees at Radius. That group of employees work tirelessly on the fundamentals of the company, controlling what we can control and moving the business forward. And I can certainly say that over the last 2 years, the amount of effort, energy, commitment to this company and improvement across the board on the fundamentals has been significant and one that myself personally and the Board are incredibly grateful for and very proud of. 
Thirdly, and as Owen also mentioned, the market in our space is challenging and has been challenging from an equity point of view, certainly in 2022. The headwinds have been significant macro point of view. And again, we all live and work in the environment that we work in. And while that wasn't a direct view of things, it certainly is something that we and the Board were aware of. 
So with that, with a particular emphasis on the rigor of the process and the breadth and depth of the process and the sharing of that information from a merger documentation point of view and specifically the effort of the employees, which has been very significant over the last couple of years on improving all aspects of the business. We thank you for your time this morning. We look forward to sharing the merger document information. And with that, Owen, I'll turn it back to you.

Thank you, Kelly. We hope that this is a positive outcome for our shareholders. We believe it is. We look forward to speaking with each of our shareholders over the coming weeks as these documents are made forth. And with that, I will turn it back over to the operator and conclude the call. Thank you.
