--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to this webcast. We are here to talk about the two announcements we have made today. Eris proposes to acquire the India branded formulations business of Biocon Biologics and 19% stake in Swiss Parenterals from Eris Promoter Group. At the outset, let us start by talking about our two key strategic objectives in the acquisition of Biocon business, India branded formulations.
This is an out-and-out Sterile Injectables business. Through this acquisition, we are achieving two key strategic objectives. Firstly, this is a great platform to jumpstart our India branded Sterile Injectables business. It gives us an entry into Critical care and Oncology. Secondly, it gives us leadership in Insulin and an Anti-Diabetes franchise of nearly INR1,000 crores in size.
Put together with the Swiss Parenterals deal, which was announced last month, we have a bunch of synergies, which can be leveraged for speedy value creation. Talking a bit more about this as we are able to share the big picture with you now. The Swiss Parenterals deal and the Biocon India branded business deal, these were conceived together, they were evaluated together, and we always saw the deals as belonging in one basket.
They got done one month apart. But we are now in a position to share the integrated deal thesis with you. Just to recap, Swiss Parenterals is a dossier-driven Sterile Injectable business in RoW markets, an impressive product range with more than 190 unique existing molecules and a pipeline of more than 40 new molecules and enabling a range of new growth opportunities for Eris, including India branded Injectables, oral solid dose in RoW markets and Injectables in RoW markets.
What does the Biocon India branded business bring to us? It is a branded Injectable business with a revenue base of more than INR360 crores per annum and has an attractive product portfolio spanning Insulin, Critical care and Oncology.
It brings Basalog and Insugen, two power brands and the largest Indian brands of Glargine and Human Insulin, each being a INR100 plus crore brand and it gives us an entry into Oncology with three mainstream MABs aggregating to INR80 crores in revenue. What are we trying to do here?
What are we trying to put together? The Biocon business with a revenue base of INR360 crores we believe is the ideal launch platform for us to address the India Injectables market. We will be able to quickly scale up this business with new product launches from the Swiss Parenterals current and pipeline basket of more than 230 molecules.
The Biocon team will transition to Eris pursuant to this deal which will help us ensure continuity of doctor and channel relationships. This deal will create the fifth largest Diabetes care portfolio in India with a revenue base approaching INR1,000 crores per annum.
The notable part is, this is probably one of the very few cases where we have a significant footprint in Oral AntiDiabetes as well as Injectable Anti-Diabetes. This will leapfrog the Eris Insulin franchise to a leadership position with the addition of two power brands, Insugen and Basalog and we have significant margin expansion potential in the acquired portfolio by leveraging Swiss manufacturing, in-sourcing and long-term supply agreements with Biocon.
Put together we are targeting our next INR1,000 crores vertical, which is in Sterile Injectables, where we are looking at a 3-4% market share in the INR30,000 plus crore market over a 3-4 year time frame.
Now we will go into the details. A quick recap of Eris' journey in the Insulin business. We entered the Indian Insulin market in January 2022 with the formation of a 70-30 joint venture with MJ Biopharm. We commercialized two products, Xsulin and Xglar. We achieved a quick scale up of a greenfield business wherein we did INR18 crores of revenue in the first financial year.
This year we are looking at INR48 crores to INR50 crores of revenue and we are currently doing a monthly run rate of INR5 crores of sales and we are targeting the launch of Liraglutide in the month of April. Biocon's Insulin portfolio will leapfrog us to a leadership position. Basalog is the largest Indian brand of Glargine in the market with a market share of around 10% to 11% by volume.
It is the only Glargine biosimilar with clinical data on complete interchangeability with the innovator product Lantus. Insugen is the largest Indian brand of Recombinant Human Insulin in the market with a market share of 10% to 11% by volume and 14% by value.
The combined revenue of these two brands is in the vicinity of INR200 crores per annum. We will continue our existing brands Xsulin and Xglar as well, put together giving us a higher share of voice in the market.
Moving on, Biocon's Critical care portfolio has a revenue base of around INR80 crores per annum with leading brands in important segments like Immunoglobulins, Human Albumin, Enoxaparin, Heparin, and several ICU Antibiotics. With a field force of more than 70 personnel, the unit has comprehensive coverage of hospitals across the country.
We have an immediate opportunity to start cross-selling the Swiss Parenterals' product portfolio through this channel, including niche inhalation anesthetics Sevoflurane and Isoflurane and we have margin expansion opportunity by leveraging the Swiss Parenterals' manufacturing footprint for in-sourcing and technology transfer.
The Oncology portfolio of Biocon brings us three significant MABs with an aggregate revenue of INR80 crores per annum. The first of these Biomab is a product called Nimotuzumab, which is India's first novel MAB for head and neck cancer. The interesting part about this product is that it has a huge range of potential additional indications, which are approved in other world markets, including Pancreatic, Esophagal, Glioma, et cetera.
Canmab and Hertraz are the first biosimilars of Trastuzumab to be approved anywhere in the world. These were co-developed by Biocon and Viatris and they address large indications for HER-2 positive breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. Put together, the two brands have a combined market share of 9% in a market which is growing at more than 30% per annum.
Krabeva and Abevmy, which are biosimilars of Bevacizumab, are approved for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and a wide range of other cancers. The combined market share of the two brands is 6% in a market growing at 26% per annum.
An employee base of 40 including more than 30 medical reps are transitioning to Eris as part of this deal and we are very happy with this distinctive product portfolio which also has room for significant expansion for new product launches.
We are also happy to note that this deal is in line with the salient features of our M&A strategy, which is, number one, expanding our presence in existing therapies and or entering new therapies, turning around fundamentally good businesses that are sub-optimally run, targeting quick value creation, looking at a turnaround in 12 months to 18 months from acquisition.
We achieve all this by rolling up our sleeves and doing the hard work and sticking to our financial metrics in terms of a one-year forward EBITDA multiple of 10 to 12 times and looking at assets with adequate growth potential and margin expansion potential.
Whatever has been demonstrated in terms of value creation in some of our earlier deals, the Strides deal for example which we did in 2017, we picked up a brand called Renerve which has grown 2.5x since then. We picked up a CNS franchise in the Strides deal which has scaled 4 times since then.
The Zomelis brand that we picked up from Novartis has grown 9x since acquisition and the Dermatology basket that we put together in FY23, we have already spoken to you about it in the recent past in terms of how we have created value there. We expect a similar trajectory of value creation in the deals that have put together in this financial year as well.
Talking a bit about the deal contours. We have signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Indian branded formulations business of Biocon Biologics Limited and the scope of the acquisition includes multiple aspects as a going concern.
The entire India branded business with a current revenue run rate of more than INR30 crores per month, trademarks and licenses pertaining to of 20 all mother brands and net working capital. Pursuant to the transaction, over 435 employees including 325 reps will join Eris.
We have signed a 10-year supply agreement with Biocon for sourcing Drug Substance and Drug Products with an option to technology transfer the manufacturing to locations of our choice. The consideration is INR1,242 crores including net working capital and will be funded through debt financing.
We expect the transaction to achieve financial closure before April 15. The next announcement is that Eris Lifesciences proposes to acquire an additional 19% stake in Swiss Parenterals from the Eris Promoter Group. This was a temporary bridge arrangement as discussed with you last month which is now being reversed.
We would also like to take this opportunity to underscore our commitment to deleverage our balance sheet. As you all know, our cash flows have been strong and sustained over the last six years with an average OCF of 75% of EBITDA and we expect this to continue in the years to come. These cash flows will enable debt servicing as well as principal repayment from FY25 onwards.
We expect that net debt at the end of FY25 will be less than 2 times of one-year forward EBITDA. Putting it all together, we have added a number of strategic growth engines over the last two years. Injectable Anti-Diabetes, Dermatology, we have created a platform for Indian Sterile Injectables, we have gotten into strategically important therapies like Nephrology and Oncology.
We have created a platform for OSD exports and Sterile exports. Put together, this gives us the platform to look at a revenue of INR5,000 crores in the year FY28. Our strategic objectives for the next three years would be, number one, integration, and value creation from the deals, number two deleveraging of the balance sheet, and number three achieving the set revenue target.
That concludes our presentation. We are open for Q&A.

================================================================================
q-and-a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi guys, thanks for the update. Just a couple of questions. On the Biocon portfolio, what are the GCs for this portfolio, between Injectables, Biosimilars and Insulin business?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so look, that is where we have come in. We were trying to put both deals together, but it didn't happen. I will just give you an example. For example, the Critical Care Division business, in the old hand was more about 21%-22% GC.
But when we did a calculation of how, when it is shifted to Swiss, how does it move? It goes almost close to 50%. Those were the synergies we had planned, with both the deals together. But for some reason, one deal got a little postponed.
When we do an Injectable business, which is without Insulin, the Injectable business should be at 50% GC, though it may take time to get there like a couple of quarters maybe. Insulin, we are very happy the way Biocon has supported us. We are getting far better margins than we used to get for our Xsulin and Xglar.
Another one or two quarters we will be fitting these things together. In the mid-term, there is a potential of Insulin to have a 70% kind of gross margin. This is what we can see as of now. We need to get some more time; we just closed the deal.
But largely, 70%. MABs the hero MAB, the Nimotuzumab is having a GC of more than 70%. The rest of the GCs are more like 30% to 40%, but there is some scope there in terms of moving the supply and those things. Those things are a little work in progress. But these two businesses largely have this kind of GC in the mid-term.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Just to get a sense on the supply arrangement that you entered for this with Biocon. So, Biocon will essentially be manufacturing those biologics and Eris will be marketing them, right? That will be pertaining to the biosimilars business only, right? The peptides and the Insulin business, will it extend to that as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Insulin majorly. Insulin is the largest piece. There are two very large brands. So, Insulin majorly plus all the MABs. You are right, the other products which don't have manufacturing capability as of now, were already at a third-party location. In our view, most of them will transition to our own Injectables plant and that's how we have put the GCs to work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GCs that you enumerated in your address before, those are the GCs that will be relevant to Eris, is it? That is supply arrangement from Biocon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, these are the GCs which we will achieve in the mid-term, say two quarters from now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, ok. I guess from considering that now the leverage on balance sheet will look like somewhere around 3,000 crores if not wrong, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, not to Q3.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, from here on, my sense is that a large portion of your bandwidth will go into integrating everything that you have acquired for the next 2 years. Correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely. Absolutely. We used to say earlier if something exciting comes our way, we don't know, but we are putting another caveat there. We have expanded quite significantly with what you saw in the slides. These are all brands which will give us huge headroom for growth. So, we are simply putting our heads down and looking into serious execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, guys, and all the best.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tarang.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you let us know what has been the revenue run rate for the two Insulin brands, Insugen and Basalog in the last 5 years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I calculated the 12-month period since it is March. It is the number which we displayed. Both put together are in the range of INR200 crores largely sharing INR105 crore and INR101 crores kind of a number.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sir, the reason I am asking this is because at least as far as I have the AIOCD data, it's showing that sales in the last 5 years flat at around INR200 crores. Is my understanding correct, here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal, if I may give the AWACS perspective. Let us divide this into Human Insulin and Glargine. The Human Insulin market by volume has actually declined as per AWACS data. In terms of units, you see a de-growth over the last 5 years. The market share of Insugen in unit terms has grown from around 8.5% to around 11% over the last 5 years.
So, actually, Insugen has taken share in unit terms from the innovator brand. When you look at this kind of a market, it is unit growth and the unit share which is strategically more important. If you look at Basalog, again, Glargine is a market which has been growing at around 2%-3% in unit terms and the market share of Basalog has also significantly expanded in the way we shared on the slides. These brands have actually expanded their market share and grown faster than market in the last 5 years.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My question is, in value terms. While you are gaining market share, I understand that, right? But in value terms, both these Insulins aren't growing, is that correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, they have been flattish, Kunal. There have been a couple of reasons. Glargine, if I remember correctly, 2 years back came in NLEM and there was a 20%-25% correction in the price across the board. I can't really put my finger on the point, but yes, they had. Have these products been doing wonderfully well in the last 5 years?
The answer is no. One of the reasons was that there was an NLEM component there and understand that Human Insulins are now moving to a lot of hospital supplies where there the data is a little bit here and there. Largely what you are saying is right. The growth hasn't been phenomenal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, and maybe then, would you like to share what we should expect from this portfolio in the next 3 years, the Insulin portfolio?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal, we will come back to you by the end of the quarter. We will get some more time to just put the numbers together. But having said that, you have seen our excellent performance, which has kind of come up in the last 2 years.
Insulin is something which our chance of outgrowing significantly is higher just because of the kind of product that is and the kind of therapy. I will be happy to tell you more about this once we come for our Q4 numbers. But in my view, these two brands will move very well in the market.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My second question is for one of the data points that you put in the slide. It said that you are at maybe one year forward EV to EBITDA, it will be somewhere around 12 times or something, 10 times to 12 times , right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The press release says that you have bought it at 18x, right? Which basically means that the EBITDA of the acquired business should move from INR70 crores to INR100 crores, right, in just one year's time. I just want to understand if, let's say, we just discussed that the revenue is not growing as much, then how can the EBITDA in one year move so much?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How much of that will come in-house next 12 months, only INR80 crores, INR85 crores of existing C. We plan to grow that 88, if you remember, when was showing you the last, you know, squeeze, we said we'll make posted INR120 crores in the general injectable space.
So all the internal injectable space will be done in our factory. Obviously, the largest piece out of that will be will be continued buy on it apart between the tiers and NDP and some of it would be from like you were talking about couple of those with continental.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And just one more question again, a clarification. So this INR1,242 crores includes the working capital, right.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, Kunal, you are taking me back to the Oaknet deal. I remember the same question at that point in time. Look, in the first year, we do manage costs very well. This time we have the people around. The number which we are telling you, 10 times to 12 times in my mind we have no doubt on that because those are the cost synergies which will come up.
For example, I told you when we move some of the business from third party to our internal factory, we have a very, very significant jump and the same thing will happen in the other products also. I can commit to you today that what you are talking about in terms of the EBITDA margin, it doesn't seem to be difficult. The growth number is something which will take some time and come back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just one clarification, if I can. I think Tarang also asked this question. What are the products that you will in-source manufacturing? I am sure you can't do Monoclonal Anti-Bodies and probably Insulin also Biocon will manufacture. So, out of this INR360 crores, how much of that will come inhouse in the next 12 months?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just one clarification, if I can. I think Tarang also asked this question. What are the products that you will in-source manufacturing? I am sure you can't do Monoclonal Anti-Bodies and probably Insulin also Biocon will manufacture. So, out of this INR360 crores, how much of that will come inhouse in the next 12 months?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just one more question, again a clarification. This INR1,242 crores includes working capital, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so INR1,242 crores breakup is like this. It's like INR100 crore is for the supply advance, INR50 crore for inventory and the rest is the consideration for the brands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal, it will be 3 times of revenue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunal Randeria, Axis Capital - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reason I am asking this is, in Biocon's press release, it says that INR1,242 crores and additional working capital, if any. That's why I just wanted to clarify.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so if there is additional working capital that we choose to take on, that will be a top up, but this INR1,242 crores includes INR50 crores of working capital which Amit shared.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vishal Manchanda, Systematix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vishal Manchanda, Systematix - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically, on the transfer and supply arrangement, just a clarity. Would you be procuring the API from Biocon and doing the fill and finish at Swiss Parenterals? Is that your plan?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It will be a mix of two, three things. Most of the time, MABs will be given as a fixed fully formulated from Biocon. Insulins, the DS would come from Biocon, and we will have a third party to fill and finish, at least the way they had their arrangement. It is akin to how we are getting Xglar earlier. All other products will move into our facility. Of course, a couple of them, if we don't have, will shift to third party. But that's the larger kind of broad idea.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The third party, not at the Swiss Parenterals side, you mean, the fill and finish of formulation of Insulin?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will be little clear on this. There are three components, Critical care component, Insulin and MABs. For MABs and Insulin, the drug supplies will come from Biocon. The formulation will happen at different sites including Biocon itself. The Critical care, which is largely general Antibiotics and Enoxaparin, most of it will be transitioned to our Swiss facility. The INR80 crores piece will go to Swiss. The remaining will remain largely DS in Biocon and supply with third party.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vishal Manchanda, Systematix - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gross margin expansion you shared earlier in your comment. How much would that be on account of this transfer?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CCDs will be a very large kind of game, which we are expecting. We have done those numbers. Of course, it takes a couple of quarters to get there. The other pieces, I said mid-term, Insulin is something inmid-term, we expect around 70%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vishal Manchanda, Systematix - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you.

Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [47]

Hi, Amit. On your own Insulin brands from MJ Biopharm. I think they will compete with these acquired brands as well. What is the plan there? Will we kill those brands, or will we continue to market both of them together?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul, we have seen a lot of examples in the last five years of having two brands, maybe three brands also. There have been a couple of good examples to these three brands. If you look at the size of the market which we are talking about. I think two brands can grow and also not compete with each other. The way we are positioning these brands, the market slice is going to be different so that we can grab more market share in both the worlds. But we plan and we are hopeful that there is enough headroom for both these brands to grow simultaneously.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terms of technology transfer, you explained the immediate future, but post the 10 years transfer deal is over, then will Biocon transfer technology for manufacturing of Insulin to Eris and in what manner?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul, that is something which we have not discussed as of now. We have had a tech transfer agreement within our agreement, but that transfer is more about form and fill. So, form and fill will happen sooner, and post 10 years is something which we haven't really applied ourselves as much, will take some time, we have some time to get there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EBITDA margin and gross margin expansion which we are talking about from say current INR70 crores to INR100 crores, that is possible in the current structure itself, right? Only from the complex --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that I am talking about in the next year itself, not far off.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to get this clear that till I think we get our debt-to-EBITDA to more comfortable levels, we won't acquire any further.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, Rahul, you are right. You want me to repeat that? We have enough on the plate, right? This was one thing that both the deals were conceived together, right? We are fully committed to reducing the debt and getting our heads down and work on ruthless execution. We are doing nothing else.

Thank you for taking the investor feedback for reversing the Swiss stake.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul, it was always a bridge and it was conceived like that. I would love to say thanks for your feedback, but I would again remind you it was not for that purpose. We were conceiving both of them together. It was always a bridge, and this is a fact which will remain a fact.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [57]

Thank you. And best of luck.

Thanks for the follow up. Two things, right? One, if I look at your Critical care business that you have acquired, right? What is the scope of expanding that business to whatever products that you are getting from Swiss? That's number one. Number two, just wanted to get your thoughts on how relevant the MJ-Bio JV piece is going forward. I know you answered it, but you also spoke about positioning both the businesses differently. Just wanted to get your sense on that and then a couple on financials, which I will get back on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang for the first question you need to give us time. It will take us some time to kind of put the whole thing together. But there is a possibility of newer products and there is a good possibility of expansion. What I can tell you right now, we are taking the field force size up from 60 to 132 on an immediate basis. Which is basically adding 60% or 100% more people in that unit.
We have been vocal about this that we find value in the India Sterile Injectables market, so we are putting our people behind that. To give you the growth scene. These businesses can grow very sharp because lot of them is supply. We don't have a handle of this at this point of time.
So, give us some time for you to get back. But I don't think even in this year we can tell you clearly how much we are doing. It will be a quarter-on-quarter thing. When we go through one year of learning, we will be in a better position to talk about it. The MJ piece, both the brands are important. They are doing well. It is not easy to create INR50 crores of franchise in Insulin.
These are two different teams. We think that we can sell both of them together. How do we work out with MJ is again something important because we also understand the supply of Insulin is very critical. Having one more plant is also a good idea. This is a very broad picture, but these things are coming together. As soon as we finalize these things, we will come back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just on the cost of debt here, what's the cost of debt? Given that the INR1,250-odd crores is without GST, my sense is we will see a 18% GST payout right now and then that will probably get reversed in the year itself, correct?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no GST payout on this deal. It is a slump-sale. That is the first answer. The second answer is the cost of debt is 8.65%.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarang Agrawal, Old Bridge Asset Management - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a fixed debt, right? It is a fixed cost.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, monthly reducing. Monthly reducing fixed.

Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to get this clear, on the Insulin part. On the macro side, the overall volumes are de-growing, if I am not wrong. Is that understanding correct? That is part one. Secondly, in terms of when you say we will outgrow the market, does this constitute gaining market share from the innovators and what healthcare initiatives or say PCI, Patient Care Initiatives will we kind of take to achieve this? If you could throw some light, that would be helpful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a little long one, but yes. Before we are asking what will happen in the future, let me take you back. I am sorry I am taking you back again to how Xsulin has performed. Diabetes, as some of you guys have appreciated in the past, has been one of the therapies we are quite into, and Insulin is a very integral part of this therapy.
When you see unit growth what you are saying is right, but when it comes to Insulin, the datamight not be all reflective because lot of the usage happens in other places than the OPDs. There is a little bit of a caveat there. But we believe that having a green field project vs having a brand which is not a known brand.
The typical history of an Insulin brand is, the older gets better because availability, the cold chain, the supply chain and the confidence of our Health Care Professional is very important. Therefore, you know when we were launching Xglar and Xsulin, we were very clear that we will go slow and this is what happens when we go slow. But when it comes to Basalog specially, I think we have a lot of headroom.
Look at the data, interchangeability data. It is actually called Bio-same. So, interchangeability data is something which no other Glargine has. If everything goes well, this is the brand which should sell the most.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But my question is, when the industry itself is declining in volume, our growth will come from adding new patients, completely new patients, who were not getting Insulin in the past or gaining market share from the incumbents, at a faster rate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Largely, Rahul, it is gaining market share, right? At the same point in time Glargine initiations are far more than Human Insulin. It is a combination of gaining market share and gaining new patients. Both put together, basically will come together.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Salvi, Franklin Templeton - Analyst    [70]

Thank you.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, please click on the raise and I can tap available on your toolbox.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we have no more questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just extending Rahul's question. Effectively, what kind of volume growth are we expecting in this market for next one to two years?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Bakshi, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Managing Director, Executive Director    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar, we will talk more about this when the quarter ends and we also get our hands on the whole thing. It is just coming. I would request you to wait for a while. Once we are done with this quarter, we will come back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondly, given that INR80 crore is what you highlighted, that can be outsourced to, or let's say that can be in-sourced to Swiss Parenterals, remaining will still remain with Biocon, right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar, the remaining will be a combination of Biocon and third party. This is a layered conversation. It is very difficult to explain it in black and white because there are two components here. There is Drug Substance and then there is Drug Substance to Drug Products.
As part of the supply agreement, we have a technology transfer arrangement with Biocon, whereby the DS to DP technology will be transferred to any location of Eris's choice. It is up to us to decide whether this will be Eris or whether this will be Swiss or any other location.
That is one level of manufacturing. Then there is a second layer, which is where will the DS come from. For the foreseeable future, the DS will come from Biocon. As said earlier on the call, we also have a second source for the DS which is MJ, which is a good thing to have. It is that kind of arrangement that will play out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just effectively trying to understand the improvement in gross margin that can happen because of these changes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Tushar. We articulated earlier on the call that we see Insulin's gross margin at around 70% levels in the next couple of quarters itself, right? That is going to be a combination of all these arrangements. As far as the Critical care margins are concerned, we spoke about gross margin expansion from 20% to 50% as soon as we bring most of it in-house.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal - Analyst    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least that much improvement in profitability is very much given and then whatever rationalization of field force and all that will further increase the profitability. Is that the right understanding?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no rationalization, Tushar. We don't need to do any rationalization. We guided you to an EBITDA. This acquired business has an EBITDA of around INR70 crores in FY24 and we are talking about an EBITDA of INR100 crores, INR110 crores next year. This is something that will come by margin expansion. We don't need to do any rationalization. In fact, Amit apprised the group that we are actually doubling the field force of critical care.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tushar Manudhane, Motilal Oswal - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've got it. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take that as the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to Mr. V. Krishnakumar for closing comments. Over to you, sir.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krishnakumar Vaidyanathan, Eris Lifesciences Ltd - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Director    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you all for your participation in this call. We are very excited about the two deals that we have put together in the last two months. We believe that this is the start of something big and exciting and we are all charged up and motivated.
We have a clear line of sight for INR3,000 crores of revenue next year with similar kind of margins. That base organically growing to reach INR5,000 crores in the next three years. We are committed to de-leveraging the balance sheet. We are looking at a debt to EBITDA of less than 2 times by the end of FY25 on a one year forward level. On that note, thank you all for your support and we look forward to your continued support. Have a good evening.
