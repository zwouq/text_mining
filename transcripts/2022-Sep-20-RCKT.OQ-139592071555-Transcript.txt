--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jessie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This is an exciting day for both Rocket Pharma and for Renovacor and I'm truly honored to be announcing what we believe will be the creation of the world's leading cardiac gene therapy company. We're thrilled to have found an amazing team and partnership in Renovacor, who share our mission to become a true beacon of hope and to find cures as newly emerged leaders in cardiac gene therapy. We are excited to be working towards common goals, including elevating the lives of patients and families around the world through gene therapy. Now there are many compelling benefits to this transaction, and we've got a lot to cover today.  
But first and very importantly, we are announcing today's news with an eye toward strong momentum in our Danon disease program, RP-A501 -- we just announced that we will have an update on September 30 with pediatric and long-term adult data with the webcast to discuss these results. Of note, we also remain on track to have FDA guidance before year-end on study endpoints and design of a potentially pivotal Phase II trial and initiation of start-up activities this year. Slide 3 is a brief agenda for today.  
Slide 4. First and foremost, it's important to emphasize that this acquisition perfectly matches our mission of developing first, best and only in class therapies for rare diseases with extensive unmet need.  
Now let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about the strategic rationale for this transaction, which are encompassed in the 3P. Number one, pipeline; number two, property, intellectual and number three, people. This acquisition truly solidifies our position as a leader in the cardiac AAV gene therapy space by expanding both our clinical and near clinical assets. So about number one, extending the pipeline Renovacor expertise addresses a very significant unmet medical need in BAG3 associated dilated cardiomyopathy, a severe form of heart failure and represents an important commercial opportunity, 1 that's actually comparable to the opportunity represented by our Danon disease program in terms of number of patients with unmet needs; number two, intellectual property. 
This acquisition also adds broad IP and provides freedom to operate and optionality to address factory associated dilated cardiomyopathy. Number three is my favorite, the addition of expert people and personnel. This acquisition adds personnel with gene therapy expertise in world-class collaborations that beautifully complement the current Rocket team and capabilities. Of note, the acquisition will also add approximately $38 million in projected cash at closing, which will extend our cash runway into the second quarter of 2024 now.  
So let's go to Slide 6 to briefly highlight the transaction. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire Renovacor, 1 of the leading companies delivering precision therapies for genetically driven cardiovascular and mechanistically related diseases, -- this is an all-stock transaction with an implied per share value of $2.60 at an exchange ratio of $0.1676. The total implied equity value of the transaction is approximately [$53] million based on common outstanding shares. Renovacor shareholders will own approximately 4.6% of pro forma equity on a fully diluted basis. We expect the transaction to close by the first quarter of 2023.
Slide 7. Renovacor Science is well developed with the technology that is ideally suited for the BAG3 biology and the mechanism of action is particularly well defined where the corrected protein made in the target cell for a disorder caused by single gene mutation can improve the lives of patients. They have also already established relevant and achievable clinical endpoints for the program.  
From a CMC viewpoint, this program is compatible with Rocket's extensive in-house AAV CGMP manufacturing capabilities to support both clinical and commercial products and scale up. And Renovacor boasts very impressive scientists with deep cardiac expertise and other associates with a proven track record in drug development. Their team has already engaged extensively with health authorities to outline the predictable review pathway forward for BAG3 and we're thrilled to be working with this driven and talented team.  
Slide 8. So what are the keys to Rocket's success so far. We've grown rapidly in a way that is allowed to previously activate 4 INDs in just 6 months, and now all these programs have reached clinical proof of concept, including 2 in the pivotal registrational stage. We have a focus on targeting genetically defined diseases. We have well-defined developmental and regulatory pathways with clear endpoints to studies. We've refined gene therapy approaches and technologies that give us the best chance of success with a clear competitive advantage and we have developed both scientific and drug development expertise in the therapeutic areas that we tackle.
Likewise, Renovacor adds true value for us in each of these areas. First of all, their personnel like ours are passionate drug developers. Their capabilities in cardiac AAV gene therapy will bolster our industry-leading cardiac platform. Secondly, their proprietary technology and BAG3 mouse model adds to Rocket's portfolio. Renovacor has targeted a monogenic disease with validated endpoints that clearly impact patient outcomes in this disease BAG3-DCM has very compelling preclinical data in an area of significant unmet medical need.  
Now on Slide 9, as you can see, Renovacor's BAG3 dilated cardiomyopathy program now gives us a total of 5 programs and growing. All programs can be considered to be first, best and only in class, all have an on-target mechanism of action and clear definable endpoints. All have addressed -- all can address markets of a size that have maximum patient impact and as noted before, programs that we develop now will be Danon size or nearby such as BAG3 and Renovacor's BAG3 program also qualifies for orphan drug designation, which we will provide updates around in the coming months. 
Slide 10. So here is BAG3 physiology briefly and how it regulates critical functions in cardiomyocytes. First of all, it enhances contractility. Second, it provides structural support. Third, similar to Danon, it's involved in autophagy and protein quality control. Fourth, it's involved in anti-apoptosis. Given all of the above reasons, we believe that a gene therapy approach is best positioned to restore the broad biological functions of BAG3 in the heart, and Rocket has specific experience in doing exactly this from bench to clinic.  
Slide 11. Here are some of the preclinical data from the mouse model, where we see AAV9 BAG3 preventing the onset of cardiac impairment. On the left side, you see mice with reduced BAG3 protein levels about 50% who develop reduced ejection fraction, validating this model. And on the right-hand side, compared to the control mouse group in red, -- the ones with AAV BAG3 treated mice stabilized over 6 weeks in terms of ejection fraction and look similar to wild-type mice. So we see very encouraging preclinical data here and believe that correcting mutated BAG3 has the potential to enhance cardiac function and extend life in many affected patients.
  
Slide 12. BAG3-associated DCM is a rare genetically driven form of heart failure, and we believe that the true prevalence of BAG3-DCM in the U.S. alone may be as high as 30,000 patients and is expected to grow with increased genetic testing and disease awareness. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutic options designed to address specific gene mutations that result in DCM or heart failure of any kind. 
Slide 13. So I want to showcase where the new Rocket Pharma together with Renovacor are today and show where we're going in the near future. We are transforming from a clinical-stage company to a near-term commercial stage company. We specialize in monogenic diseases with dual platform in both ex vivo lentivirus and in vivo AAV we will have near-term lentiviral-based program commercialization soon and also AAV9-based Danon program updates very soon as discussed. And we're now in the process of transforming into a true revenue-generating company with our Fanconi Anemia and LAD-1 programs, followed by Danon disease, BAG3-DCM and PKD. We will have additional new Wave 2 therapies to be announced in 2023 that are also on track.  
Slide 14 is a snapshot of our financial position. We're expecting to add $38 million in projected cash at our core closing -- Renovacor closing, which is expected by first quarter of 2023. This will extend the balance sheet into the second quarter of 2024 further from our previous guidance, which was into first half '24. Of note, this includes $46 million in gross ATM proceeds to date, $26 million was just from last week. We will continue to be opportunistic in looking at both private or public financings as well as nondilutive options such as monetizing the 2 PRVs and 1 from Fanconi Anemia and 1 from LAD-1 upon FDA approval by 2024.  
So to sum up and give you an overview of our progress to date in cardiac gene therapy -- as we've reported, we expect our Phase I pediatric cohort data in Danon disease in third quarter, actually just in a couple of weeks. This could be a powerful validation of Rocket's efforts in cardiac AAV gene therapy. We're also on track to have our FDA end of Phase I meeting and anticipate initiation of Phase II pivotal trial activities in Danon disease by the end of this year on track.  
We expect to file a BLA and MAA for LAD-1 in first half 2023, and for Fanconi Anemia in 2023. We will initiate Phase II pivotal trial for PKD as well in 2023. We anticipate preclinical data and updates on the clinical development plans in BAG3-DCM in the near future and we do feel there's strong potential to initiate a Phase I trial in BAG3 in 2023. And finally, we'll have even more additions to the Wave 2 pipeline entering the clinic in 2023.  
I wanted to note that our manufacturing facility in Cranberry is now producing clinical material to support the pivotal Danon disease trial with buy-in from the FDA.  
Those are the end of my remarks, and we will move forward with Q&A this time. Thank you, everybody, who's joined this call.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tyler Van Buren with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tyler Martin Van Buren,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the transaction. I have a couple for you. I guess the first one is the preclinical ejection fraction data is interesting. But do you expect that you'll see the same histologic changes as you've seen with LAMP2B. 
And then the second question is I believe the severity of the disease is lower than Danon. And so can you speak to the confidence that you have in administering AAV9 to these patients based upon the latest safety data that you've seen from the Danon program?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Great questions, Tyler. So some of this will develop as we start working more and more closely together with the Renovacor team, who are the true experts in BAG3. But my sense is that protein expression is very important. We're all interested in it. In Danon disease, we have the benefit of having both protein expression and a histological readout as we've seen -- that's not going to be the case for all diseases. I think in this disease, ejection fraction is such a powerful clinical surrogate and it's going to hold a lot more weight, and we're going to be focusing on that as we develop our program forward. 
With regard to AAV9, so we will await the emergence of ongoing preclinical data that Renovacor has been working on for quite some time with regard to AAV9. And what I can say now is that we're very confident about the AAV9 safety profile based on our experience in Danon disease, and we will think carefully about the best path forward that's most optimal and efficient to get this drug to patients with BAG3. So we'll be creative about that, but we've had great experience with AAV9 so far, as you know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Gregory Harrison with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Allen Harrison,  BofA Securities, Research Division - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on deal. Does the acquisition of a cardiomyopathy program with similarities to Danon imply an increased level of confidence in what you may see from the Danon program, just deciding to focus a little bit more in that area. And then how are you thinking going forward about the balance between your AAV and antiviral programs in your pipeline?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So we can't clearly foreshadow obviously, what will be read out in Danon, but we feel very good about the data we've seen to date, and we feel very good about an FDA dialogue based on everything we're seeing in Gestalt right now and Danon we're extremely optimistic. I would say that in general, if we had not been confident about Danon, then we would not have brought this program in. 
With regard to lenti and AAV balance, we are seeing them as the right and left eye of Rocket, depends on which one, which of your eyes is preferred. Lentivirus will be the commercial arm of Rocket as we move forward over the next 2 to 3 years. And AAV will be in the development stage. Obviously, AAV will also become commercial at some point. But we're focusing on Lenti in efforts to develop commercial infrastructure. We're focusing on our AAV and efforts to develop our R&D and science pretty rapidly. So that's how we see it. They're complementary and both equally important to our future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Gil Blum with Needham & Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Analyst,   -     [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is Chen for Gil. So it seems most of the patients of BAG3-DCM are diagnosing adults -- so why this disease doesn't show up in childhood as a genetic disease. And our follow-up is how would you view it influence on the probability of success for the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's a great question, Chen. Thank you. So Danon disease was very unique. Danon disease is known to be one of the most aggressive forms of cardiomyopathy and very few other diseases will be as aggressive in children. And I think that was a well-known and well-established fact already. However, we have to look disease by disease, and we have to see what is the best clinical end point. And if there is a surrogate endpoint that can reliably predict long-term clinical outcomes in these patients. And even though these patients are adults, there are patients who progress rapidly and whom we can measure end points that would have a significant and meaningful delta versus natural history of these patients. Ejection fraction is one example. 
So even though it's an adult disease, it does progress rapidly in some patients. We would identify those patients, treat them, show that delta and then expand the label to the broader population over time, the same approach as we're using in Danon and other diseases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Dae Gon Ha with Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dae Gon Ha,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hope you guys can hear me and apologies for the background noise. Congrats on the deal. Just 2 questions from us. One is looking at the timeline slide, perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but Renovacor slide showed that our (inaudible) was IND bound for second half and number 2 it seems like your slide is somewhat slower than that. But correct me if I'm wrong, are you pursuing RCSI administration or the IV administration since that was the 2 that the company was pursuing?
And how might that impact your Danon administration now as well going forward? 
Second question is, if we look at the preclinical data that you showed on Slide 11. I was just wondering, is there an established threshold that you need to achieve with the expression level of that release for clinical benefit? And I guess I'm just wondering, looking at the 2 graphs in the metal, purple and green things like wild type with BAG3 expression seems to be somewhat lower than the wild type of the control of BAG3 administration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So with regard to IND and clinical timelines, let me address that, and then we can get back to the best surrogate tissue marker for predicting response. I think those are the 2 questions. So for the IND question and the local versus [IV] delivery, this is something that we're actively working closely with the Renovacor team. I think that the data with the local approach have been a great start. And right now, we're not changing any guidance on the actual IND filing, regardless of when that IND is filed, the clinical entry would be 2023, even if that IND is filed on track. So I want to make that point. 
In terms of whether long-term, we pursue IV or local, that remains to be determined. I think we have a lot of experience with IV. And if that's the most efficient and effective treatment for patients and path forward for patients, then that's what we'll do. So that remains to be seen. 
In terms of what is the best marker of clinical predictiveness, protein expression. There are many ways to measure protein expression. I think one of the ways -- one of the things we're going to do is sort of make our protein assays compatible and reproducible across all of our programs, and we need to bring some of these assays in-house so we can compare apples-to-apples and not apples-to-oranges. So when someone has a protein expression number, you can't always compare that with a number from another company. So we need to establish, validate and make these assays uniform number one. 
Number two, we think that even before protein expression, vector copy numbers are an important surrogate and getting and titrating that in the best manner possible upfront and being confident that we'll achieve the appropriate vector copy numbers to affect these tissues and the tissue pathophysiology is also important. So these are all scientific questions that we look forward to tackling together with the expert, Renovacor team in the coming weeks and months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Eric Joseph with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric William Joseph,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - VP & Senior Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a few from us. Can you talk a little bit about how distinct DCM is as a consequence of BAG3 deficiency? Are there other phenotypes or symptomatology that pairs with DCM in these patients. And then following up to that, to what extent are there sort of development and regulatory synergies that came in Danon and the BAG3 program particularly on the development side when it comes to patient enrollment. 
And then finally, if you don't mind, just sneaking this last 1 here. Just what -- can you just talk about whether the deal gives into consideration here for the -- for Renovacor's, other programs, either other indications were focused on BAG3 or the DCM focused pipeline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I remember of question 1 and 3, we'll just have to come back to question 2 in a second. So BAG3, so the question is are patients with BAG3 who have DCM, is the DCM attributable to BAG3 or are there variations. This is a population that is increasingly becoming studied now. We're going to be working and collaborating with some of Renovacor's World partners, but also some of our own to answer some of these questions that you're asking -- but our general sense is that the DCM from BAG3 is related to BAG3 itself. It's -- I don't think that there's a lot of variation in that answer. 
Second, I'll answer your third question. With regard to other cardiology assets, we think that Renovacor has had a great eye on discovering and finding other assets as well. The [ARVC] asset out of Utah is very interesting to us as well and will form a future part of our Wave 2 or Wave 3 pipeline depending on how rapidly we can move it into the clinic. And I'm sorry, your second question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric William Joseph,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - VP & Senior Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second question, development synergies between the Danon and BAG3 program as it relates to patient enrollment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So developing AAV expertise is not easy. And I'm not just talking about from a company perspective, but from a treatment site perspective, to develop centers of excellence that are conversant with the ups and downs of AAV gene therapy is challenging. We've been very fortunate to work with some centers who have gained a lot of experience in a short amount of time. So we would definitely synergize extensively on clinical sites -- we would also synergize extensively on patient advocacy groups and patient finding measures. That's actually -- I should have mentioned, that's actually how the Renovacor and Rocket relationship started. It was identifying patients around the world with cardiomyopathies through patient advocacy groups and other genetic databases. That's how our collaboration started. So that's also a big synergy there. 
And then I would say there's so many synergies here, right? We mentioned clinical, we mentioned patient finding. There are numerous synergies on CMC. AAV platform is something that we've been working on for several years. We've developed our platform externally with the CDMO and now brought the manufacturing as well as the quality testing and release testing in-house. So we have a lot of experience on how to synergize CMC. And then, obviously, on the science front, we figured out how to identify disease, find the best vector for the disease, little variations in vector design go a long way. So we look forward to doing all of that now together with Renovacor. 
And then finally, on the regulatory pathway, we have the same reviewers at the FDA as some of the same reviewers as Renovacor does. And we've already built these relationships over many years, and we hope to build on those further to even further and better accelerate the Renovacor program along with the rest of the Danon programs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric William Joseph,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - VP & Senior Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. That's very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously, that was my favorite question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Patrick Dolezal with LifeSci Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Edward Dolezal,  LifeSci Capital, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the transaction. Curious if there were any additional preclinical data that Rocket saw that was informative in this transaction, but wasn't disclosed today. Just given that Renovacor did intend on presenting some preclinical data in the second half of this year. I'm kind of curious when those might be released publicly in light of the transaction. And then as you've learned from the data and experience, sometimes patients are a bit too far progressed for gene therapy intervention and setting a lower bound on the ejection fraction as 1 means of kind of mitigating the issue -- and so the question is kind of given substantially reduced ejection fraction as part of DCM. How do you think about the optimal time of intervention?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick, thanks for the question. So obviously, as part of our review of Renovacor, we had access to a data room. And all I can say right now is that the data room definitely gave us further confidence of the viability of an AAV approach for this target and we look forward to furthering those preclinical studies and revealing those data as the time comes. As far as the appropriate patient population for BAG3, I would say that, yes, there are some very direct applications from Danon disease. There is a point of no return in Danon disease. Similarly, there may be a point of no return in BAG3 patients. How you define that point of return, though differs disease by disease. In Danon disease, there's extensive fibrosis at the end of life for these patients, which drops the ejection fraction. 
It's a different disease, right? It's a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy EF is preserved in those patients. So if EF drops, that's usually means it's too late. In DCM, though EF is not preserved. So lower EFs do not preclude patient enrollment in the same way as they might in Danon disease. So it's a very different disease, very different pathology. And we will still find the patients who will benefit from gene therapy but in whom it's not too late yet. We feel confident about being able to identify those patients as we develop our Phase I further.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Raju Prasad with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raju Yashaswi Prasad,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about how you're thinking about dose in the BAG3 trial, just given what you know from Danon and the differences and maybe the ages and weights of the patients in both indications?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's an excellent question. So we will work on this in the coming weeks and months as we learn more and more about the target, the current approach, which is local and other options as well. I think that drawing from Danon, obviously, we've learned a lot in so many aspects of dosing and CMC, what are the safety issues associated with AAV9, what are the ideal drug product parameters that can reduce some of those safety issues, we've learned a lot. We're going to apply all of that with a reasonable degree of confidence on the Renovacor program to find the most efficient path forward. 
And as I mentioned, this -- the data that we've seen so far in the target using AAV is very compelling. And we also have alongside this current program, the optionality to be creative around other methods as well. So more on that as we move forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raju Yashaswi Prasad,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And then on the manufacturing side, how are you thinking about it strategically with the IND filing and your own in-house process? Would you kind of bring it in-house and kind of recapitulate the data for the IND using in-house vector? Or are you planning on taking into Phase I/II with the current data package and then kind of recapitulating it later with your in-house process?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. It's an important question. I'm sitting here next to Kinnari and [Mayo]. And I think our general approach here is that the Cranberry manufacturing facility is dedicated to programs that have reached clinical proof-of-concept and where we think commercial scale-up in the near- to medium-term is critical. And before we bring a program into cranberry, we will likely develop the process externally, validate through clinical proof-of-concept and then tech transfer in-house. That's been the way we've thought about this so far. Just reserve the right to change the strategy in the future, but that's how we're thinking about this. 
So this way, Cranberry manufacturing is fully dedicated to a place where we can be confident about scaling up for now, Danon, in the future could be others as we develop some of the ideas outside of this facility. That's how we would think about it right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a question from Timur Ivannikov with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timur Ivannikov,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on the acquisition. So we just have a follow-up question regarding the dose you just mentioned you're still looking at it. But looking at Renovacor's data in pigs, it seems like a dose of at least [5E13] would be required. Do you see think that's your minimum effective dose? Or do you think you could go lower than that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaurav D. Shah,  Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that the path forward here will include a careful evaluation of the RCSI approach. That's the first thing we're going to do. We, like you, recognize the importance of adequate vector copy numbers into cardiomyocytes. The cardiomyocytes in the heart are one of many types of cells. So just like we mentioned earlier that you can't compare protein assays from company to company from academic program to academic program, we've come to learn that you can compare -- you cannot compare vector copy numbers from one lab to the next either. And the way that people assay tissues differs as well.
So we want to consolidate everything in one place first, compare side by side what the local vector copy numbers might look like versus the Danon data, where we know we have clinical efficacy and go from there. And again, as I mentioned, we have optionality with this IP to pursue several types of approaches as we find the most efficient path forward.

Okay. And just maybe just a quick question related to an earlier question about potentially lower disease severity for BAG3. Looking at the animal data that's been presented by Renovacor. Just looking at the data, it seems like they're comparing heterozygous animal model to wild type. Do you have data showing how much gene therapy it corrects homozygous genotype?

It's an excellent question. So there are homozygous models out there that have early mortality in mice. And that's why this hetero middle balance model seems to make the most sense. And I will say that the discussions with the agency so far have been quite supportive of that model, to be clear. 
Again, we will look at all options for preclinical paths as we put our clinical plans forward for this target.

There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any other remarks.

We are very excited. We are at the beginning of a new journey as leaders in cardiac gene therapy. We're very excited to warmly welcome the Renovacor team into the broader company, and we look forward to engaging further with them as well as all of you in the coming months as we develop our franchise. Thank you for coming today and listening in.
