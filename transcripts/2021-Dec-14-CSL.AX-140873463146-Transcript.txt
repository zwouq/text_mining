Good. Thanks, operator, and good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to CSL's briefing on today's announcement about the tender offer to acquire 100% of Vifor Pharma Ltd. As just mentioned, it's Mark Dehring speaking, and joining me online is Paul Perreault CSL's Chief Executive Officer; Joy Linton, CSL's Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Mezzanotte, CSL's Executive VP, Head of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer. And Paul will be providing an overview of the transaction highlights. Then Joy will provide some additional detail on the financials. And then, of course, we do have an opportunity for Q&A. 
(Operator Instructions) Please note, this briefing is being recorded. And lastly, before we start, I draw your attention to the core statement disclaimer contained in the slide deck. 
I'll now pass you over to Paul Perreault. Paul?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Mark, and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're thrilled to share news with you today on our agreement to acquire Vifor Pharma, which we announced after closing of the Australian market this afternoon. I'm excited about this transaction and what it means for CSL and, more importantly, for patients around the world. 
I'll begin with my thoughts on how Vifor Pharma aligns with and accelerates our long-term strategy. I will give an overview of Vifor Pharma's business and how the pro forma company is well positioned for success and continued growth. And Joy Linton will then discuss the financial terms of the deal and walk you through how we plan on funding the transaction. 
So let me draw your attention to Slide #5. Hopefully, you've been able to download the presentation. And I'll start on Slide 5, which is really talking about the transaction highlights. Today's announcement represents a meaningful acceleration of our 2030 strategy by further enhancing our focus on our therapeutic leadership areas of innovation and sustainable growth. Importantly, this combination adds a complementary and leading nephrology business underpinned by a unique and durable joint venture with Fresenius Medical Care and a portfolio of commercial and pipeline assets in nephrology dialysis and iron deficiency, which augments CSL's existing focus areas and adds logical new adjacencies. 
CSL has had a long and successful track record of identifying serious and life-threatening conditions, solving them through scientific research and innovation and bringing safe and reliable products to patients. Through this acquisition, our global reach, our R&D capabilities and balance sheet will help accelerate opportunities to bring new and innovative products to the large and underserved community of renal disease patients. In addition to the strong strategic merit of this transaction, the acquisition fits strongly with our disciplined financial approach. Significantly enhances our revenue and free cash flow generation, the acquisition is expected to deliver low to mid-teen NPAT and amortization per share accretion in the first full year of CSL ownership. We are also pleased to reaffirm CSL's fiscal year '22 NPAT guidance of USD 2.15 billion to USD 2.25 billion. 
So let me pass it to Joy to provide you the financial details of the transaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon and evening, everybody. I would like to reiterate our excitement on the announcement that Vifor Pharma will be hopefully joining the CSL Group. 
So on Slide 6, let me provide a brief summary of the transaction. The transaction is an all-cash public tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Vifor Pharma in Switzerland for USD 179.25 per Vifor Pharma share, payable in U.S. dollars. The offer price implies an aggregate equity value of USD 11.7 billion or AUD 16.4 billion. We expect to fund the acquisition through a combination of a fully underwritten institutional placement, a committed debt bridge facility and existing cash and undrawn facilities. We will also undertake a non-underwritten share purchase plan to eligible CSL shareholders, and we're targeting to raise up to AUD 750 million. 
CSL expects the transaction to provide, as Paul said, a low to mid-teen net profit after tax, but before amortization, per share accretion in the first full year of ownership, including full run rate cost synergies. Our pro forma FY '21 net leverage will be approximately 2.65x, and we have the ability to rapidly reduce our debt based on the strong cash flow and earnings growth profile of the combined business. The transaction is expected to complete by the middle of calendar year 2022 and is subject to the customary tender offer conditions and regulatory approvals. 
I'll now hand back to Paul to provide an overview of the Vifor Pharma business and to outline the strategic rationale for the transaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Joy. Before I give you an overview of Vifor Pharma, let me highlight some of the key strategic rationale for why we're doing this deal. So I'm on Slide 7 of the deck at this particular point. This acquisition represents a rare opportunity for CSL to augment its business with successful products and an attractive pipeline that underscores complementary and adjacencies to our existing areas of focus and interest. 
And I have to say that this type of a transaction -- as all of you are well aware, CSL does not take on transactions every day. We take serious thought about what's going to fit with our strategy. It's all about maintaining our strategy that's made us successful as a growth company, and this strategic rationale fits exactly with that. It strengthens CSL's strategy by adding this durable and growing business with leadership positions across nephrology, dialysis and iron deficiency. It builds a significant renal franchise, becoming the partner of choice in a growing renal disease market, and we'll talk more about that. It extends the reach of CSL's high-value pipeline in the renal space by leveraging enhanced access to unique patient population and supports clinical trial execution. Also, it provides a complementary portfolio and provides an opportunity to build new adjacencies. As Joy pointed out, it materially enhances our scale and free cash flow and, finally, provides this compelling financial profile. 
So if we go to Slide 9 for an overview of Vifor Pharma. Vifor Pharma is one of the largest Swiss pharmaceutical companies and a leader in nephrology, dialysis and iron deficiency with revenues in excess of CHF 1.7 billion. Chronic kidney disease is a key focus area for Vifor Pharma, its large and expanding market affecting approximately 15% of adults in the U.S., for instance. Through its clinical and commercial leadership and its unique partnership with Fresenius Medical Care, Vifor Pharma has established itself as really the partner of choice in the nephrology space. Vifor Pharma has also been a pioneer in iron-based therapies, addressing a significant need and contributing approximately half of its revenue. 
Moving on to Slide 10. Vifor Pharma really has an attractive product portfolio, and we're particularly excited about this portfolio. You'll note that across nephrology and dialysis, there are 4 key commercial products, and it is expanding rapidly with the launch of up to another 4 new products in '22 and '23 and a deep pipeline ranging from early stage through mid- to late stage, which is expected to provide durability and growth over the longer term. 
Moving to the right side of this page on Slide 10. Vifor Pharma is a leader in iron deficiency with a highly profitable franchise which brings significant future promise across heart failure, initially in Europe but eventually also in the U.S., and the opportunity for geographic expansion in markets, including China, Brazil and Latin America. Based on the geographic footprint that CSL brings, this is a great adjacency for us to continue to look at growth. 
If we move on to Slide 11. Vifor Pharma has a highly collaborative and productive relationship with Fresenius Medical Care. It owns 55% of the stake in the Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma JV. The partnership was forged in 2010 and has achieved global leadership in the treatment of dialysis care. Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma's distinctive model is unique to Vifor Pharma and does not exist in any pharmaceutical company. It truly accelerates innovation and improves drug development process through sharing of ideas through collaboration, through better sourcing of innovation, an improved clinical trial design and execution and naturally better outcomes for patients, which is what we're all striving for. 
We move on to Slide 12. Vifor Pharma also has an excellent track record for sourcing new products and developing products and launch. Vifor Pharma's revenue has grown significantly over the past 10 years, including a sevenfold increase in Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma to over CHF 0.75 billion. Vifor Pharma has a history of driving value through strategic partnerships, as I've mentioned, and evidenced by the formation of more than a dozen successful business development partnerships spanning multiple assets and geographies. The business development pipeline is rich with 4 potential new product launches in the '22, '23 time frame, coming from previous activity that BP has undertaken. 
If we move to Slide 13 now. Let me take a minute to walk through the details of these potential near-term product launches. These are highly indicative of our forward momentum within the neurology business. Along with its partner, Cara Therapeutics, Vifor Pharma announced the FDA approval of IV KORSUVA in August 2021. KORSUVA is the first and only approved therapy for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis, a condition that affects approximately 40% of hemodialysis patients. We expect the promotional launch of KORSUVA in the U.S. in the fiscal quarter 3 of 2022 and potential EMA approval in fiscal quarter 4 2022. 
Vifor Pharma and its partner ChemoCentryx announced the FDA approval of TAVNEOS, or avacopan, in October 2021 and received a positive EMA CHMP opinion in November 2021. TAVNEOS is an oral first-in-class therapy for a rare and serious disease called ANCA, or ANCA-associated vasculitis, AAV. TAVNEOS reduces the inflammation and damage to small blood vessels, and the European launch is planned in fiscal quarter 4 of 2022. 
Rayaldee is approved for the treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism, SHPT, in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and low vitamin D levels. Vifor Pharma in-licensed Rayaldee from OPKO Health and expects to launch the product in Europe in fiscal quarter 3 2022. 
Vadadustat is a potentially first-to-market oral investigational HIF-PH inhibitor currently under FDA review for the treatment of anemia related to chronic kidney disease. The drug is developed by Vifor Pharma's partner, Akebia. And Vifor Pharma has commercial rights across U.S. dialysis centers, excluding DaVita. And the data set has a PDUFA date of March 29, 2022, followed by a potential launch in 2022 or 2023. So as you can see, a very strong portfolio of pre-commercial products and up to 4 launches in the next couple of years. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Beyond the 4 product launches, Vifor Pharma has novel pipeline across nephrology and dialysis. And it's clear that partnerships, such as the in-licensing of Travere's Sparsentan or acquisitions like Sanifit, have enabled Vifor Pharma to continue to fill out its pipeline with assets across various stages of development. This generally reduces the risk profile of the development pipeline. And as these assets continue to progress through development, we expect to see them increasingly important, especially in the back half of the decade. 
Moving now to Slide 15 and talking a little bit about the history of driving growth and the value that Vifor has developed through these strategic partnerships. And this is really to finish off on the Vifor Pharma's overview section, just to highlight their strong track record of delivering the value through these partnerships. This has really been a cornerstone of Vifor Pharma's growth strategy. 
Vifor Pharma's leading position in nephrology is built on the Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma's distinctive model, which makes it a highly attractive commercial partner for companies with innovative nephrology therapies. Vifor Pharma has also expanded its global reach through best-in-class partnerships with American Regent and Fresenius Kabi in China. Vifor Pharma's ability to continually expand its innovative portfolio by acquiring and in-licensing novel late-stage therapies is evidenced by the formulation of more than a dozen successful business development partnerships spanning multiple assets and geographies over the last 6 years. 
So if we move now to Slide 17. And I touched on this earlier, which is the strategic rationale. You can see that what I've outlined here, through Vifor's strategies and where they've been, is really why we see this as such a compelling rationale to the deal. So I'd like to walk you through this and really make sure that you understand where we're coming from. And the fact this is not a divergence from our strategy, it absolutely aligns with where CSL has been and where CSL will go into the future. 
So moving on to Slide 18. Following the acquisition of Vifor, the combined group will have 3 leading segments. And you'll see from the pie chart the pro forma revenue contribution from 3 business units: 70% from Behring and the remaining 30% evenly split between Seqirus and Vifor. 
Moving on to Slide 19. Through the JV with FMC, we gained preferential access to a large pool of clinical-stage nephrology assets. And it is estimated that the market size for renal will grow from 2020, last year, of about USD 13 billion in terms of market to USD 25 billion by 2026, double-digit growth year-on-year over the next number of years driven by an aging population and increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease arising from risk factors such as diabetes and heart disease. 
Moving on to Slide 20. You can see the key attributes of the renal disease market, and this really talks a bit about where these patients are and what's happening. You can see the key aspects here, and this represents the large and growing opportunity. Chronic kidney disease is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. In the U.S. alone, there are approximately 15% of adults that have chronic kidney disease, and this number will continue to grow as the population ages. Furthermore, the need for dialysis is growing significantly with 360 people every day beginning dialysis treatment for kidney failure. 
Moving on to Slide 21. We see a significant overlap between CSL and Vifor Pharma's portfolios across some of our key focus areas. As you can see from the graphic, we are engaged in exploring several common disease areas but are also able to layer on adjacencies to really look at areas in our portfolio where we can fuel growth. Areas of key focus are cardiovascular, hematology and transplantation. Both CSL and Vifor Pharma have commercial and pipeline products supporting hemodialysis, especially as it relates to cardiovascular events, blood disorders like sickle cell disease and renal indications like diabetic kidney disease. Vifor Pharma also brings in new disease areas through its iron franchise with a significant opportunity in patient blood management, particularly in hematology, with a focus on beta thalassemia and, of course, heart failure. These are natural adjacencies for us, and coming together will enable us to further our development and commercial efforts and find ways to deliver greater value to our patients and to our shareholders. 
If we move on to Slide 22. You can see that in Slide 22, it brings together some of the key rationale for the value of the acquisition, highlighting how our collective renal assets are highly complementary and, through the Fresenius joint venture, could accelerate progression of the CSL high-quality renal assets through better use of patient data and treatment algorithms and, as an example, clazakizumab in Phase III as a potential first-line treatment for antibody-mediated rejection in kidney transplant patients. 
Slide 23, moving on. It's evident that Vifor Pharma brings a relatively well-balanced mid- to late-stage pipeline to CSL. It adds 8 clinical-stage assets across multiple indications and 5 registrational life cycle projects, one of which the data stat has a PDUFA target date in late March 2022. This distribution and expected movement of assets across phases layers in added long-term growth in the second half of the decade, with nephrology franchise becoming a meaningful contributor to the growth in the pro forma of the company. 
Moving on to Slide 24. The impact of Vifor Pharma acquisition will meaningfully impact our financials with a substantial uplift in revenue and free cash flow. And this increased scale positions the business to further explore and open opportunities for continued execution of R&D and future growth in our key therapeutic areas across our portfolio. 
Moving to the last slide that I have at the moment, so this will be Slide 25. As Joy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we expect the transaction to provide low to mid-teen NPATA after amortization per share accretion in the first full year of CSL ownership, including the full run rate cost synergies that we've outlined in the ASX. We also expect to retain balance sheet flexibility with a pro forma net leverage of approximately 2.65x. We have the ability to delever based on the cash flow profile of the combined businesses. 
I'd like to now hand over to Joy to take you through the transaction funding.

Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much, Paul. Now I'm on Slide 27. So as previously mentioned, the all-cash tender offer of USD 179.25 per share represents an aggregate equity value of USD 11.7 billion. This transaction will be payable in U.S. dollars and will be funded via: firstly, a fully underwritten institutional placement of USD 4.5 billion, that is AUD 6.3 billion; and a fully committed debt bridge facility of USD 6 billion as well as existing cash and undrawn facilities of USD 2 billion. We'll also be undertaking a non-underwritten share purchase plan, targeting to raise up to AUD 750 million. And under the SPP, eligible shareholders will have the opportunity to apply for up to $30,000 of new shares. And we are planning to take out the debt bridge facility in the capital market. 
On Slide 28. The equity raising involves a fully underwritten institutional placement of new fully paid ordinary shares in CSL to eligible institutional investors to raise, as I've said, approximately AUD 6.3 billion. And we'll also be undertaking, as I've mentioned, a non-underwritten SPP, targeting to raise AUD 750 million. 
But first, focusing on the institutional placement. It's fully underwritten and is expected to result in approximately 23.1 million placement shares being issued at the underwritten floor price, representing just over 5% of CSL's ordinary shares on issue. The placement price will be determined by our bookbuild process commencing at AUD 273 per share, which represents an 8.2% discount to the last closing price of $297.27 yesterday. Eligible institutional shareholders who bid at the final placement price for an amount less than or equal to their pro rata share of placing shares will be allocated their full bid on a best endeavors basis. The placement shares will rank equally with existing CSL ordinary shares at their issue. Eligible professional and sophisticated shareholders in Australia and New Zealand who wish to participate in the placement should contact their broker for further information, and priority will be given to broker bids that support existing shareholders. 
Secondly, as we have outlined, in relation to the SPP. Following the completion of the placement, CSL will offer existing eligible shareholders in Australia and New Zealand the opportunity to participate in the non-underwritten SPP up to $30,000 per holder. The issue price for the new shares under the SPP will be the lower of the placement price and a 2% discount to the 5-day VWAP of CSL shares up to and including the closing date of the SPP. The number of shares received by SPP participants will be subject to the overall level of demand and any scale-back. The scale-back methodology will ensure that, subject to the $30,000 maximum application limit, participating shareholders will receive an amount of new shares that at least maintains their percentage shareholding in CSL prior to the announcement of the placement and SPP or is equivalent to their application if that is lower than their pro rata amount. And as I've already mentioned, SPP shares will rank equally with existing CSL ordinary shares from the issue date. 
More details will be available in the SPP offer document which is expected to be sent to eligible shareholders next Tuesday, the 21st of December, when the SPP opens. 
On Slide 29, moving to the timetable of the equity raise and just outlining some key dates. The placement bookbuild is now open and will be completed overnight, tonight and tomorrow, with trading resuming on Thursday, the 16th of December, and the SPP is expected to open next week with an extended offer period to Monday, the 7th of February. 
As a management team, we've always said any acquisitions by CSL would be strategically strong and financially attractive. And hopefully, you can see that Vifor Pharma business is just that. 
And with that, I will hand back to Mark to handle some Q&A.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good. Thank you, Joy. Thank you, Paul. I'll ask the operator, if you could open the lines. And I see we have some questions lined up. Our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall at MST. (Operator Instructions) Go ahead, Andrew.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Goodsall,  MST Marquee - Healthcare analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was going to ask some of the synergies, the $75 million, just where that's coming from particularly, and the timing that you expect that to be delivered, I guess, sort of in terms of first, second and third year roughly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll take that, yes. So thank you, Andrew, for the question. So the $75 million is after 3 years, and we just projected them equally over that 3-year period. This is not a particularly big cost synergy -- these are cost synergies, the $75 million and the normal areas that you would expect from procurement to some of the enabling functions. But the deal is much more about the growth and revenue synergies that we think we can deliver over time. And that is not in that $75 million synergy number. That's just the cost synergies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Goodsall,  MST Marquee - Healthcare analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps then just turning to the growth. Just it seems the business has been partly impacted by COVID, just the visibility that you're bringing to, I guess, your own forward estimates and how you're sort of thinking about the recovery there and I guess, obviously, in context of the pipeline that you've got there as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I think that we take a look at where the opportunities arise here. You saw the growth that we see in the nephrology business and especially chronic kidney disease and those areas of dialysis. And yes, they were impacted by COVID because they're patients with comorbidities. So actually, there were a number of patients that passed away in the process of COVID around the globe in some of these areas. 
But we see this continued growth. People continue to -- the population continues to age. We see the comorbidities not coming down, and we see more and more therapies that can come in here. These are very complex patients in that area that, actually, one particular product, and we talked about this with things like Ig in our portfolio before. Finding one product to solve all the issues associated with the immune system or in this chronic kidney disease area is going to be very, very difficult. So there's lots of assets that potentially can help these patients, and we have the way to deliver. So it's really about looking for that future growth and making sure that it's there. 
They also have a very, very strong iron franchise, as you know. This is a leading company in iron replacement, and that's going to go on for quite some time. And so I think there's some real benefits there for us to be able to look at geographic expansion and potential indication expansion that we see, having been in the cardiovascular and hematology area, in terms of the focus areas of our therapeutic areas within CSL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good. Thank you, Andrew. Our next question comes from Saul Hadassin at Barrenjoey Capital. Go ahead, Saul.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saul Hadassin,  Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited, Research Division - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've got 2. First one, Paul, obviously, a key component of this business for Vifor has been the relationship and the JV with Fresenius Medical Care. Can you talk to have you had any exposure or access to talking to that part of the business to assess sort of their view on what this type of transaction, what implications might be from their perspective?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Paul. Look, yes, I have spoken to the folks at Fresenius Medical Care. And I have to say because we had not closed the deal, I mean there is limited discussion. All I can tell you is that Fresenius -- and we do deal with Fresenius in a couple of areas already with some of the work we do with HIZENTRA and some of the filling of some of the products there -- but I can tell you that very aligned on the patient focus that they bring to this area of dialysis and renal care. They are experts in this field. They have a very large number of patients that they manage, the largest network of any other company in this space. And I can say that my conversations and exposure has been nothing but extremely positive. This has been going on for over a decade, this relationship. They see real value in this relationship and what's been created and the value that's been created for them, for Vifor, but mainly for the patients. 
And I think I'm very excited and enthused about the relationship. They're innovative. They're constantly thinking, and there's some really good things that they're doing not only in patient care but reimbursement side of the business and a number of other areas. So very impressed with what they've done and how they've grown and their real aspiration to continue to grow and to grow this relationship.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saul Hadassin,  Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited, Research Division - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just one more. The risk section of the presentation talks about patent litigation for that key iron infusion product. I was just wondering if you can give us any sense of your assessment of that case. What are you expecting in terms of potential competition for Injectafer in coming years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, Saul, I mean we're very comfortable with where Vifor's management has managed this litigation. That's been going on for a number of years, so it's not new. And certainly, in our diligence, we've looked at it. We think they've done a great job managing it, and we expect that they'll manage it through to fruition. This is a complex product manufacturing. This is not your typical small molecule biologics product that has a very steep curve. I think that it's more of a biosimilar-type product, and so it's difficult to manufacture. We all know that and so do the other players. But this is a huge market at the moment. And this franchise will continue to grow for a number of years. And if we can continue to add value and expansion and geographic expansion, I think it's going to be a pretty sustainable business for us. So we've taken all that into account with this deal, and we're very comfortable where we sit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Saul. Next question comes from Steve Wheen at Jarden. Go ahead, Steve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven David Wheen,  Jarden Limited, Research Division - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a question on the portfolio of products that sit within the chronic kidney disease segment. There is one, I think it's called Mircera, which has come under some pricing pressure of late. I just wanted to try and understand what the main cause of that has been and whether or not its pricing level is found in your base. That would be my first question, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Steve. Look, I think Mircera has -- it's interesting, Roche is a great company as well, and they've done a great job of working with Fresenius to launch this product. When they launched it, the value of this JV was clearly known because they basically ran out of inventory pretty quickly after launch because of the uptake. But look, I think all products in this space are under pressure just because of the bundle of cost and package that goes into the treatment. So we think there's still plenty of upside and plenty of penetration that will come. So if you live in the U.S. at all, like I do sometimes, drug pricing is constantly under pressure, and I expect that we'll continue to manage it. But I don't see anything definitive here that's causing a major issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven David Wheen,  Jarden Limited, Research Division - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. And my second question is, I noticed you referenced the heart failure opportunity, based on what I've read, the Ferinject does have some characteristics which stabilize patients after a heart attack, which sounds somewhat similar to the intent behind CSL112. I just wonder how those 2 sort of opportunities sit alongside each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I have Dr. Bill here with me, so I'm going to it throw to him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Mezzanotte,  CSL Limited - Executive VP, Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thanks for the question. So Injectafer has done a fair amount of work -- or of course, Vifor for Injectafer, on the use of iron to stabilize and improve functional outcomes of people with congestive heart failure. And that congestive heart failure, by the way, could be because of a previous myocardial infarction or some other causes. And they have a study ongoing right now to prove the same dynamic that they've proven in Europe and the United States. An exact overlap between these 2 products for the same patient will remain to be seen. Of course, we hope that CSL112 will be treating patients earlier and maybe they won't even have the heart failure to begin with. But certainly, this kind of approach and interest in heart disease is partly why this portfolio makes sense with us.

Thank you, Steve. Next question comes from Sean Laaman at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Sean.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sean M. Laaman,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Australian Healthcare Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul, you mentioned some of the synergies by taking the Vifor products and, I guess, sort of cross-selling them into some of CSL's channels, internationalization, that type of thing. Is there much flow the other way from your existing portfolio and selling it down Vifor channels?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Sean, for the question. I think as we look at the channels that Vifor has already established, it's really about some of our newer assets that will come online later in our portfolio. So Dr. Bill, during the R&D Day, outlined a number of areas that we're developing right now. And I think as we look at the development of some of those assets, there's opportunity for us, and I mentioned, for instance, the Vitaeris product that we talked about in transplantation. And also, when you're talking about the kidney disorders and you look at that marketplace, there's multiple things that are driving that market to expand so rapidly. And so whether it's transplantation and kidney disease or whether it's other areas, we think there's opportunities there to drive that. 
So again, very complementary and adjacent to where we are. And I've always said that not being serial acquirers, we look at things where we can add value, not just buy something to grow because we don't have another strategy. We've had a very strong strategy of base growth. They have a very strong base growth business plus the opportunities to really optimize the portfolio. But we bring scale to this, Sean. We bring scale and geographic reach. So we're going to look both ways for sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sean M. Laaman,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Australian Healthcare Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks, Paul. And maybe a question for Joy. I mean I know there's obviously no fiscal '23 guidance out there, but you do talked through the accretion that this deal brings and we can kind of grab a consensus for Vifor and work up a number. But at the moment, it seems that the increasing implies an EPS outcome close to $5 versus $6 in '23 for the existing business. Is there anything wrong with that rationale?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's very strongly accretive, Sean, is what I would say, both on a fully reported basis saying it's immediately accretive in '23 and, in the ASX announcement, you'll see we've used the language of sort of low to mid-teens in terms of accretion on like a cash equivalent, but it's NPAT minus amortization -- or adding back amortization. So yes, so it's strongly accretive in the first year. And then, of course, once the synergies flow through into the -- that accretion grows over that 3-year period, so yes. Now you're -- I mean I can't particularly -- I don't recognize your $6 specifically but I would have [thought] every bit of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good. Thanks, Sean. Next question comes from David Low at JPMorgan. Go ahead, David.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Low,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul, you've outlined the growth opportunity and it does seem quite compelling. So could I get you to compare a little bit how that growth outlook compares to the existing business, particularly the plasma products? I mean are we to read into this that Vifor and its renal franchise is a better growth opportunity over the next 5, 10 years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, I wouldn't say so, David. I'd say it's complementary. And the 2 together just make it even a stronger case, right? So when you take a look at our portfolio, and again, the good doctor outlined that at R&D Day in terms of what's in our pipeline, we're so excited about our current pipeline of products that, that opportunity at the right time, that makes sense for us to add to the growth of the organization. 
I think the outlook for plasma products continues to be strong, especially over the near, mid and later part of this decade. We don't see the underlying demand for Ig going away. We don't see those things happening. We look at the portfolio across our therapeutic areas, and we've got some really good shots on goal. This adds to that portfolio. So it is a growing area. It's coming from a smaller base in some areas, but it's a big market in the nephrology area. And so there's some real opportunities there. And there are some adjacencies within nephrology and then hematology, iron, the heart SID that we talked about. I mean there's a number of areas here that really add to. And you look at that one slide that has all of the R&D projects, it's really filled out nicely with the addition of Vifor. 
So look, I wouldn't try to compare the 2 because there's opportunities in both areas that will help. I mean the Behring business is still 70-plus percent of the business moving forward, and that's going to be a continued driver of base growth. And that beautiful, strong base that many companies would kill to have in terms of the growth rates, I mean many of these pharma and biotech companies are struggling, especially the big ones. People our size, they're struggling for 3% to 4% growth. And so we're looking at our growth profile and really excited about the combination of the 2. 
So I love all my children, and I see Vifor as part of the family, and so I'm not going to compare one to the other. And in that respect, we're going to take the best assets forward for the company and for the patients. And whether it comes from Vifor or whether it comes from Behring or Seqirus, those are the ones we're going to continue to invest most in to accelerate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Low,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. I mean I guess perhaps staying with the same topic, I mean when I look at the businesses, they still seem quite separate. I mean I think a salesperson in the plasma space, plasma products, the hematology or immunoglobulin, isn't really going to pick up these products and start selling them. Or am I missing something? And I guess in the same vein, I mean are we talking about businesses that's to be done fairly separately [at least where we sit]?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, I think that's a fair call. We have a lot of work to do. I've only been at this about 1.5 hours. But what I can say is that they've done a really good job, and I'm not going to go in and just disrupt things, right? We need to understand the business deeply, like we do the rest of our business, as we come together as one organization. When I say one organization, you're right, it doesn't -- we can't make iron in a plasma facility, right, or vice versa. So operations-wise, that will be separate, clearly. Commercially, when you look at their business, a lot of it is done with partnerships and JVs and relationships. And so it's not necessarily the call point because the channel is through Fresenius Medical Care for a lot of these products as well and that JV and what they bring to the party. 
So you're right. I mean this isn't your typical pharma deal where you've got tons of synergies because you're going to cut 2,000 people out of the sales force and bring it together. That's not what this deal is about. It's about the pipeline. It's about the adjacencies. It's about the investments. And that's really where we see the compelling nature of this deal. That's why you don't see big synergy numbers that Joy pointed out earlier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next question comes from John Deakin-Bell at Citigroup. Go ahead, John.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Deakin-Bell,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Head of Healthcare in Australia & New Zealand    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul, I'm just interested in, strategically, how you got comfortable with the assets that you're buying because a big chunk of your business is protected. They're not patent protected, but there's manufacturing and a lot of infrastructure that goes in, which has meant that the industry is being very tight. And particularly now, as you've consolidated it, the Ig, albumin, et cetera, there's only minimal competition and there's no patents. Whereas, here, you're moving into an area where patents start to become far more important and, that at some point, unlike Ig and albumin, which have been growing for 30 years and you haven't ever worried about it, you've got to think about it. So strategically, how have you gotten comfortable about moving into quite a different mindset?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, John. I don't really see it as a different mindset in a lot of ways. So I'd like to say I haven't worried for 30 years about the plasma business, but the reality is I probably have and as all of you have because, in our discussions, there's always the risk of Ig going away with anti-FcRns or something else or whatever the flavor of the day is that, that seemingly could disrupt. And look, at some point, there's disruption. I think that what I see in this business and the iron business, for instance, continues to grow. Will there be some infringement later in terms of patents and will there be patent expiries in this business? Sure. That will happen. But these are also complex products to make. They're not small molecules that you're trying to copy. It's an interesting and difficult manufacturing process, much like plasma, right, in that respect. So there's that opportunity that we have to protect and really grow and expand geographically that business well ahead of threats and things coming our way. You know that we look at these things deeply to make sure that we're adding value. 
In terms of the renal space, the number of products that are going to be used going forward, as you see this market continue to grow, because of the comorbidities in nephrology, in the renal disease area, there's opportunities for us to continue to expand because there will be products that could be coming out of the armamentarium. But with these patients, if you move one thing with these patients in terms of therapies or polypharmacy, it impacts something else in the system. These are complex patients that have a lot of interdependencies in their anatomy and biology that just don't get solved by one particular thing going off patent. And I think that's the beauty of the polypharmacy that we see here is the opportunity to continue to treat patients and improve patients and improve their therapy because there will be new things coming. 
I mean KORSUVA is something that's quite interesting because, if you think about it, and people think, well, pruritus and itching, it can't be that big a thing. Well, you talk to the dialysis patients, it's serious. I mean this really impacts their life. And these are just side effects of other products that you have in this polypharmacy armamentarium. So when I look at the business, and look, as you know, we have looked at a lot of things all the time and we don't do too many deals, right? We're not that "serial acquirer" that we've talked about. And I've said that for about the last, I don't know, 9 or 10 years that we have a good strategy. And whatever we would do has to fit with our strategic intent and our portfolio, our adjacencies and be complementary. And that's what we've got here. 
And yes, there's going to be patent close. But you know what, some of our current portfolio that we're developing also will have competition because they're not necessarily plasma-based therapies, as Bill outlined in R&D Day. When you take a look at where we're heading with EtranaDez, this is going to be unique, this is going to be different, but there's lots of people attempting to come into gene therapy as well. So I see this as part of the evolution of CSL but still having some very strong defensive positions while we see growth occur. And man, you can't ask for more than that, to have growth with some defensible positions that even with patent expiries, you still have opportunities to continue to grow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Deakin-Bell,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Head of Healthcare in Australia & New Zealand    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's very helpful. I just had one question for Joy. I am also struggling with this EPS accretion, getting to the same number. But it depends on what your FY '23 number is that you're using to start with. Can you just confirm, what have you used as the base number? Is that a consensus number?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Yes, we've used the Vifor consensus number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Deakin-Bell,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Head of Healthcare in Australia & New Zealand    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, no. For CSL. You used your consensus, yes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Good. Thanks, John. Next question comes from Gretel Janu at Credit Suisse. Go ahead, Gretel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gretel Janu,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So firstly, just in terms of returns, the returns that Vifor has achieved historically has been lower relative to what CSL has been able to achieve. Has this been due to kind of the greater earnings exposure to iron deficiency as opposed to nephrology and renal, which really seems to be the growth engine going forward? And I guess how has that impacted your thinking in making this acquisition?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So look, thanks, Gretel, for the question. As I've said before, I mean the renal does show growth significantly from a lower base, and so the growth rate will be higher. There's 4 new products potentially being launched in the next couple of years. That's going to add to the growth as well. And I think iron still is growing. I mean the next couple of years at least. You see the iron business continuing to expand, and we're looking to really expand and defend that business. 
And so I think with our scale, our geographic reach, our capabilities, our investment in R&D, our complementary portfolio, it's going to be a combined effort in terms of this growth. So we have to look at where Vifor was as a stand-alone and now look at it as part of CSL. And as you bring the 2 together, the overall growth rate for CSL is going to be enhanced. The returns should also benefit from that because both companies will be contributing. And when you say lower than CSL, that may be true. But when we looked at the portfolio, we see opportunities to at least match or continue to grow above those rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gretel Janu,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So you don't think it will be dilutive to CSL returns in the medium to longer term once the pipeline products launch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gretel Janu,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent. And then just secondly, one for you, Joy, just in terms of the balance sheet, 2.65x leverage. That's above historical levels. Just wondering what the medium-term leverage target is and when do you think CSL will be able to reach that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the business we're acquiring is highly cash generative, and we have a very speedy deleveraging profile, and we'll be back within our sort of guidance of sort of 1 to 1.5x quite quickly, certainly, in a way that we expect to be able to maintain our credit rating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good. Thanks, Gretel. Next question comes from David Bailey at Macquarie. Go ahead, David.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Bailey,  Macquarie Research -  Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just had a question on Vifor's physician or referral base. I suppose I'm expanding a bit on Sean's earlier question about cross-sell opportunities. I'm just wondering, with that physician or referral base, do you see any opportunities through CSL's existing pipeline products and then maybe what it could mean for CSL112 if that gets approved?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll let Dr. Bill talk for just a second.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Mezzanotte,  CSL Limited - Executive VP, Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. And so I just want to go back to kind of a question that was asked earlier about whether our products fit or there's separate businesses. In many of these diseases, as you're alluding to, it's still the same prescribing physician or groups of physicians that are working on it. So in the case of CSL112, we're talking to the hospital cardiologists and interventional cardiologists who may be closely aligned with the person who's in the heart failure clinic working with the iron product, hopefully, in the future. So there is some natural alignment there. Same with their hematology assets, sickle cell disease, we have our own product. And the treaters of sickle cell disease are not huge, and so I'm sure Vifor's product and our product will be used by the same physicians. So I think there's a few examples of that. And I'm excited when I get another chance at R&D Day to talk about all these potential alignments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Bailey,  Macquarie Research -  Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Okay. Understood. And then there was a comment, I've just lost it, in terms of the strategic [R&D] talking about enhanced access to a unique patient population supporting clinical trial execution. Just can you expand on that a bit again? Apologies if you talked about it already, but just interested in what that means or the implications of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Here's Dr. Bill again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Mezzanotte,  CSL Limited - Executive VP, Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So this patient population, as Paul alluded to, unfortunately, is a very complex population that has issues with anemia, issues with metabolic diseases, issues with cardiovascular complications. And of course, those are all areas that we have interest in with some of our medicines for rare and serious diseases. And so Vifor has done a very good job of delivering on their clinical trials in a very timely manner because of this network of dialysis centers. We can see, with potential pipeline assets in the future and some of the broadening indications we're considering, that we could utilize this network to our advantage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So it's a network really of the dialysis centers and the access to the treaters and the referring physicians that are treating these complex patients that give you the access for additional access to the clinical trial recruitment. So that's what we were referring to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, David. Ladies and gentlemen, we are running out of time, but we do have time for one more question, and that is Dave Stanton from Jefferies. Go ahead, please, David.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Andrew Stanton,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I just want to be sure -- just getting back to beating a dead horse on the synergies, I didn't quite understand the accretion. I just want to be sure it's low to mid-teens NPATA accretive, if I assume essentially $25 million worth of synergies or $75 million worth of synergies in F '23 because you talked about it sort of an even split of synergy growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joy Carolyn Linton,  CSL Limited - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer is yes and yes. So both phased synergies and run rate synergies are in that range of low to mid-teens in the first full year. And this really reflects the fact, yes, it's a strong -- synergies is not a big part of the story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Andrew Stanton,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Understood. Okay. And then perhaps a question for Paul, I know you love all your children, but I'm interested in understanding what attracted you the most to the business in terms of products and specifically what, I guess over the medium term, we should be looking for in terms of great products coming out of the portfolio or existing products in there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul R. Perreault,  CSL Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think what excited me most was the alignment with our values of taking care of patients in an underserved area that has not been highly penetrated by a lot of competitors, right? I mean when you take a look, this is one of those areas where you look at the business, for many companies, they would look at it and go, well, I'm not sure how this fits. For us, it was pretty obvious, right? I mean we've got areas of complementary adjacencies and our thinking in our therapeutic areas. We've got a complex manufacturing of a core product that continues to grow and will continue to grow and we think we can expand and defend for quite some time that generates very good returns and is in high medical need. So we take a look at all of that together. 
And this isn't the first time we've been looking at this company. I mean the first time we looked at it was a number of years ago. And for us, it's about, does it fit strategically? What is our current priority and what is our current situation in our strategy and in our strategic intent? And we think this is the opportune time to really -- and having talked with the folks there and meeting the folks there and working through the due diligence, we only confirm the fact that we think that this is a highly complementary business. It fits our strategy. It's not a diversion from anything else that we're doing. It has its own portfolio. 
And really, these relationships that they forged was really key to us. Because it's a very unique company when it comes to these relationships, especially with the American Regent-Daiichi, and especially Fresenius Medical Care. It's hard to find this type of an asset that fits so well into CSL and really is unique in the industry. So we're always a bit different. We like to think we're a bit unique. And we like hard stuff, but we also like the ability to take care of patients and drive. And that's what we find in this deal is the culture, the values, the portfolio, the access, the uniqueness that really fits with the core strategy that we've had and continue to have to grow CSL into the future. So I really appreciate the question, and we really believe in what's happening here. The management team is super excited, and we can't wait to get started.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Dehring,  CSL Limited - Head of IR    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, David. Ladies and gentlemen, apologies if we didn't manage to get to your particular question. I encourage you to drop a line to CSL Investor Relations, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. 
And in closing the meeting, thank you for your interest, and I'll draw the meeting to a close. Good night. Bye-bye.
