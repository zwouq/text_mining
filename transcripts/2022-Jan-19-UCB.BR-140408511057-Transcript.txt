Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, good afternoon to the call, Capital Market Conference Call by UCB. My name is Antje, Antje Witte, I'm heading Investor Relations at UCB. We'd like to talk to you today about our agreement we did with Zogenix to acquire the company. And before we start with our presentation, I'd like to highlight some details. Please be informed about this important information about the tender offer.
This tender offer as laid out in the presentation and in the press release this morning, has not yet started. This call and the press release are for informational purposes only and are neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation  of an offer to sell any shares of the common stock of Zogenix or any other securities. I kindly ask you to read this slide carefully.
On the next slide, I have to make you aware of our disclaimer and forward-looking statements. This is a traditional disclaimer you find in our presentations. We are talking about future events, potential future events, and we urge you to have a close look to this disclaimer and forward-looking statements, please. Thank you very much.
Now I'm happy to hand over in a second to our CEO, Jean-Christophe Tellier, who is going to lay out the strategic growth path of UCB. Charl Van Zyl, our member of the Executive Committee and Head of Neurology is going to talk to you about UCB and Zogenix serving people living with epilepsy.
Our Chief Medical Officer, Iris Low-Friedrich, is introducing to you the 2 indications we are talking about. And last, of course, but not least, our CFO, Sandrine Dufour familiarizes you with the transaction terms and the funding. And at the end, I will come back to you with the Q&A features. I'm happy to hand over now to Jean-Christophe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe Tellier,  UCB SA - CEO & Executive Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Antje. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to welcome you in our -- to our market capital call and to give you more detail on the acquisition of Zogenix that we aim to achieve, if I can go to the next slide, please. I think my objective today is to try to quickly explain to you why we found that this deal is a perfect -- almost a perfect strategic fit with UCB and today. And I would like to illustrate that through 3 lenses before handing over to my colleagues.
The first lense is an alignment with our purpose and our patient value strategy. As you know, we, at UCB, we always have the aim to deliver differentiated medicines that can help patients suffering from chronic diseases. And here, we are talking about 2 and Iris will comment about that.
We are talking about 2 very severe rare chronic forms of epilepsy that are very difficult to treat Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The product is already launched -- already launched in Dravet and is in the filing stage for Lennox-Gastaut. And in Dravet, in the Phase III, the product has already demonstrated a very significant achievement, which means that the product is on its track to become a potential new standard of care and Charl will comment about that.
So definitely, I think we can agree that from a strategic fit and from an alignment, from a purpose and from a patient value perspective, we have with Zogenix, a potential partner that can really help these patients and complement the portfolio that we have by adding a solution that will help patients that are in a tremendous need today.
The second element of this strategic fit, the second lense that I would like you to take is the epilepsy one. At UCB, we are committed to epilepsy. We are already leading for these patient populations. We aim to continue to lead, and it's one of the 5 patient populations that we aim to lead by 2025.
We, of course, have a strong commitment to Epilepsy, this has been the case for the last 20-plus years with products like Keppra, Vimpat and Briviact and others. So Fintepla is a perfect match to add to what we currently have. It's adding a new population and it's adding a new treatment that will complement what we have by treating very specific patients for a very specific disease that we are not currently addressing. So the second lens is the epilepsy lens -- and to try to understand the strategic fit.
And the third lens is the sustainable company growth lens. You know that we are aiming to grow and to continue to grow. This potential acquisition will give us an ability to accelerate our growth. It will be accelerating this growth after closing, of course. And Sandrine will talk to you more about the timing and the different element of these questions. But it will be an additional revenue for us after closing, and it will be accretive to UCB's earnings from 2023 onwards, as you can see here, which is an important element because from a timing standpoint, it's also a perfect timing for this acquisition because we are entering into a phase where we will lose exclusivity for Vimpat.
So that will give us an additional growth engine into the neurology particularly the epilepsy franchise. Next slide, please. So it's just in a nutshell, and my colleagues will go a little bit more in the detail of that. On top of the strategic fit, as you can see the considerations and the values and Sandrine will talk about that. On the funding part, we think that we are in a very strong position in order to be able to close this with just USD 800 million additional loan and from available cash sources.
And in terms of timing, now that it has been approved unanimously by the Board of both companies, we expect to close by Q2 '22, which is also for us an important element. And in terms of amount and financing amount, as you can see here, USD 1.9 billion in equity values, equivalent of EUR 1.7 billion.
So in a nutshell, a very strategic and important deal for us that will complement and continue to nurture our strategic ambitions to deliver differentiated products for very specific patients population, a strong addition to our epilepsy portfolio and on the timing coming in a moment where it will accelerate our growth and be quickly accretive. So that's the reason why from a strategic standpoint, I think it makes for us perfect sense. And with this, I would like to hand over to Charl.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jean-Christophe, and also I want to take this moment to welcome everyone to the call and thank you for joining today. And of course, we are delighted to announce this deal today, and it's really an opportunity to further strengthen our leadership position in epilepsy. And if I can go to the next slide, I wanted to just remind you for those who may not follow us that much that we have a history of more than 20 years in epilepsy and in the space and have been recognized and continually recognized as leaders in this space. And so it is really just -- not just the product, but also beyond that. Our investment in research, our collaborations on many fronts have really made us a leader in this space over the last 20 years.
And with this acquisition, we even further extend our compelling portfolio that we have. If you know us and you will know that we have 3 very strong treatment solutions for patients that treat the symptomatic space, of course, our history with Keppra. We have Vimpat, of course, and we also have Briviact there. But also through the acquisitions in the past 2 years, we have also been able to enhance our portfolio in the drug device combinations for the acute stages of seizure and rescue medicines in this case, Nayzilam and then we also Staccato in Phase 3 that will also enter into the space. And now with the acquisition of Fintepla into our portfolio, we are able to address a patient population that we've never been able to address before, Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in the rare space.
So with these -- combinations of these portfolios, of course, we really now have a very compelling offer for patients and solutions for patients across a wider spectrum. If we go to the next slide, then again, I want to reiterate here today, of course, our commitment to the long term in epilepsy, and this is another signal and a very strong signal that we are very committed to this space.
There is still a very high degree of unmet need and a number of patient populations that are underserved. So we are really very committed to the space and very clear also with this acquisition that we are here for the long term. So as we said here, very briefly, we are focused, of course, on maximizing a very compelling portfolio and, of course, very excited with the acquisition and addition of Fintepla into that space.
We have developed also other elements beyond just the scientific solutions, but of course, digital solutions as well to ensure patients have the seamless experience when they're treating with epileptic solutions, of course, and also how they interact with physicians and with others. So we're very much focused beyond just the solution also on the ecosystem how we can act as a leader across many dimensions of course. And then we are investing and continue to invest of course in early signs and discovery and a deeper understanding of the pathobiology will lead us, of course, into many solutions and the next wave of innovation that will follow beyond what we have today.
So really very strong compelling story and a strong outlook also for epilepsy for the future. If I go to the next slide, then really a very brief overview of Zogenix, and I want to take this moment also to recognize the great effort and the great value that the Zogenix leadership team have created here with the -- within the company that they have today.
And it's really -- the company that we see is a great match for us. They are value driven as we are towards patients and bring differentiated solutions to patients and also a very pioneering company that has really taken Fintepla in a new indication and taken that risk and made that significant investment with 3 Phase III programs to bring a new solution to patients with Dravet and LGS.
And they've been rewarded with an orphan status in both U.S. and in Europe. So this is clearly a recognition of being a pioneer, taking a risk and building a fantastic solution for patients that we are now able to partner together with to bring to these patients. So as a final slide, if I can go to the next slide, again, I want to just reiterate what Jean-Christophe had mentioned. It's a clear excellent strategic fit, a smart deal for UCB. We are able to now access a highly differentiated asset that can bring differentiated solutions for patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
It is regarded by many of the thought leaders as a gold standard in terms of its efficacy profile. And so we're very privileged to be able to have such an asset now in our portfolio in the future, very strong strategic fit, of course. And with our leadership infrastructure in epilepsy, we are able to reach more patients and provide patients this solution through our very strong relationships and global reach that we have as a company in epilepsy. And then the final point that has been reiterated of course, is the attractiveness as a smart deal to be accretive on growth, of course, and also on profit in the short term. So really also helping us to continue to bring sustainable growth for the company over the next 5 to 10 years. So with that, it's my pleasure to hand over to Iris to provide you a bit more of the clinical profile of our acquisition. Thank you, Iris.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iris Low-Friedrich,  UCB SA - Chief Medical Officer, Head of Development & Medical Patient Value Practices and Executive VP    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you very much, Charl. And also from my side, a warm welcome to all of you, and please move to the next slide. As we all know, the epilepsies are a group of heterogeneous neurological conditions characterized by very different types of seizures and around the world probably affecting more than 60 million people. And you also know that the biology of epilepsies is fully understood and structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune and neurodegenerative causes have been postulated.
With recent advances in science, the etiology of many epilepsies has become clearer and will result in more targeted and eventually, hopefully, also disease-modifying therapies. Currently, established treatment paradigms focus on a few broad mechanisms of action and have resulted in seizure control for about 70% of the people living with epilepsy while roughly 30% of patients remain drug-resistant.
And we are focusing on these 30% and improving the lives of these patients with uncontrolled seizure burden is of course, very much in our interest and in our focus. And these patients include rare populations with life-threatening risks and serious impact on quality of life. And amongst them, there are 2 catastrophic epileptic syndromes with onset during childhood, Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.
We move to the next slide, please. Just imagine the happiness of parents with a newborn baby that's healthy and that's developing well. And just a few months old maybe following a fever, the infant develops generalized convulsive seizures. So episodes where the entire body is shaken by muscle cramps and these episodes lasting very long. Each time may be one hour or even longer and these seizures occur very often. So imagine a life with countless emergency room visits and ICU stays with life-threatening episodes of status epilecticus, or respiratory arrest.
And of course, these thousands of seizures in the early years of life result in severe delays of development and substantial motor and cognitive deficits and have, of course, also behavioral consequences. This is the typical life with Dravet Syndrome. It is a lifelong rare disease with probably 20,000 patients and their families affected in the U.S. and also in the European Union.
More than 80% of these patients are not controlled with treatment. And the hour-long episodes of generalized convulsive seizures are very difficult to terminate even under hospital conditions, and they result in a 20% mortality rate and a substantially increased risk to die of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) or respiratory arrest.
Effective seizure control, extension of the intervals between the seizures and improved cognitive development are very key unmet needs. Please move to the next slide. We are confident that Fintepla can make a difference for children with Dravet Syndrome and their families. This is based on the data from positive Phase III trials which resulted in the approval in the U.S. and in the EU.
The clinical trials have shown a median 70% reduction from placebo in monthly convulsive seizures. The main longest interval between seizures was increased by more than 10 days from placebo.
Open-label extension studies show a sustained effect with 80% reduction of seizures at 3 years. Medically, these improvements are very meaningful and, of course, contribute to an improved quality of life.
The mechanism of action of fenfluramine, the active ingredient is via the release of serotonin and comes with the mechanistic risk of valvular heart disease and arterial pulmonary hypertension, only at high doses. Hence, FINTEPLA is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, the FINTEPLA REMS in the U.S. and a controlled access program in the EU with regular echocardiographic follow-up.  And this enhanced vigilance has not shown any safety signal so far.
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is another catastrophic childhood epilepsy. Positive Phase III results with a clinically meaningful improvement in drug seizures, the characteristic seizure type in this population, and important efficacy in the reduction of generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the foundation of the regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU.
Next slide, please. So Lennox-Gastaut is also a rare epilepsy syndrome with onset typically at the age between 2 and 7 years. It affects up to 100,000 patients, and again, families are always affected severely, just in the U.S. and in the European Union, these numbers. Patients with LGS experience many different types of seizures, atonic seizures with a sudden loss of muscle tone and falling to the ground, the so-called drop seizures are very typical. The generalized convulsive seizures are also frequent and they are the reason very often for SUDEP.
So the burden of the disease with its increased mortality and the high risk of SUDEP, the developmental, cognitive and behavioral impact and the refractoryness treatment are very similar between LGS and Dravet Syndrome.
And in both diseases, of course, early diagnosis and a multidisciplinary care team are required to mitigate the severe impact on quality of life and development. So as you have heard and know, we have a very long-standing commitment to children living with epilepsy in UCB. We have demonstrated this with comprehensive and innovative development programs of our current portfolio of anti-seizure medicines in pediatric patients down to the age of 1 month and even including neonates.
The addition of FINTEPLA to our portfolio with a different mechanism of action and addressing different patient populations will broaden our offerings to the people living with rare catastrophic epilepsies. So with that, I'm pleased to hand over to Sandrine. Thank you.

Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Iris, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. So as my colleagues have just shared with you, we are truly pleased with this acquisition. This transaction has a very strong strategic fit. It also has financial merits. It's expected to be accretive to earnings as of '23 and it supports sustainable long-term growth for UCB.
So it's a compelling value proposition for all stakeholders, the Zogenix shareholders will receive USD 26 per share at closing plus a CVR for a potential cash payment of (inaudible). After December 23, of FINTEPLA as an orphan medicine for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The total transaction, including the CVR is valued at up to approximately USD 1.9 billion, which corresponds to EUR 1.7 billion. The Board of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction. The closing of the transaction is subject to the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Zogenix outstanding shares. And the transaction is also subject to antitrust clearances and other customary conditions. We expect the closing by the end of Q2 this year and on the financing ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry. We apparently lost Sandrine. This is what happens in these unstable times. Sandrine, you're your back, can you hear us?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, look like I was cut, so I don't know where it's ..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We lost you at the financing. And the ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry about this. That's the homeworking. The financing impact, the acquisition will contribute -- sorry, on the financing, it will be financed by a combination of cash resources, available cash resources and a new term loan of $800 million. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition.
And as you know, UCB has a strong balance sheet and is entering in this transaction based on a leverage level, which is below one time having delevered since the Ra Pharma acquisition.
And including this new loan upon closing of the transaction, UCB maintains strategic balance sheet flexibility. Regarding the financial impact, the acquisition will contribute and enhance UCB's revenue growth after closing. Fintepla was launched in the U.S. and Europe in 2020 and has significant commercial potential. It will strengthen the company's long-term growth and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to UCB's earnings as of 2023.
So let me now turn to the next and the last page of this presentation. So let me recap the key merits of the transaction, which provides a strong strategic fit with UCB. The 2 companies will combine forces and maximize the impact, leveraging the strength of their teams, their expertise and their infrastructure.
So with Zogenix's presence in rare disease, the transaction complements, strengthens UCB's strategic position in epilepsy as our portfolio moves from classical seizure treatment to very specific disease populations and more rare epilepsy treatments. UCB will bring established global infrastructure and operations to support launches of Fintepla, help expand access to Zogenix products and maximize the addressable patient population. The integration, which will take place after closing is under preparation and after closing the acquisition will enhance UCB's top line growth and is expected to be accretive on earnings as of '23. So with this, let me hand over to Antje for opening Q&A session.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much all, and thank you very much, Sandrine. We'd like to start the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions)
The first question is coming from Jean-Jacques from Bryan Garnier, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Jacques Le Fur,  Bryan Garnier & Co Ltd, Research Division - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Sorry. Can you hear me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can hear you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Jacques Le Fur,  Bryan Garnier & Co Ltd, Research Division - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry for my camera, it doesn't work. So I prefer to be without it. So I have 3 questions, if I may. The first one is regarding the safety issues of the drug in the cardiac side effects. Is there any risk to see more and more cardiac side effects with increasing the number of patients to be treated because if I'm right, until now, it's about only 1,000 patients treated with FINTEPLA, what could be the risk of that? And are the side effects reversible when stopping the drug?
Second question is regarding cost synergies. Since you are now a well-established company in epilepsy, could we expect some cost synergies since Zogenix is spending about $260 million a year for R&D and SG&A. So you probably don't need these expenses due to your position in the diseases -- disease area, sorry. And lastly, could we have more sort of update on the IP position, protection, data exclusivity and so on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Sandrine, you -- Iris, sorry, do you want to start with the REMS?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iris Low-Friedrich,  UCB SA - Chief Medical Officer, Head of Development & Medical Patient Value Practices and Executive VP    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you. Very happy to do so. So as I have stated the mechanism of the potential cardiac valvulopathy and arterial pulmonary hypertension is really well understood. It's related to the serotonin agonist activity of the molecule, but it has only become visible at high doses, so 70-milligram plus. In the current program for Dravet and LGS, the dose is limited to a maximum dose of 17-milligram per day dosing per kilogram for the children and neither in the clinical development program nor in the current postmarketing surveillance has there been any observation of valvulopathy in the heart or arterial pulmonary hypertension.
So from that perspective, well-understood mechanism of action, the REMS works, provides the additional vigilance and as expected, no evidence of safety issues there. If anything would occur, yes, it would absolutely be reversible because, again, it's related to the cell energy and mechanism of action.
We should really applaud Zogenix for the courage to repurpose a very valid and valuable and effective molecule and develop it appropriately in Dravet and also in LGS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Sandrine, do you want to continue with the synergies question and then Charl will take the exclusivity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So -- Regarding the synergies, well, after closing the combination of both companies would offer potential synergies and cost avoidance while reaching to people living with epilepsy. But at this stage, we are not able to further comment on the integration on the commercial plans prior to closing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your question also, Jean-Jacques. The data exclusivity is until 2027. So that is the orphan indication. And just quickly, again, building on Sandrine's comments on synergies, I mean, clearly, we see the value, of course, of reaching more patients. So top line growth and growing the full potential of FINTEPLA and all the indications will be our #1 priority as a driver of value creation. But of course, synergies will also play an important contribution to that. But I would just want to position it as a growth asset for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jean-Jacques. The next question is coming from Peter from Citi. Peter, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you hear me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can hear you, Peter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult, Citi. Three quick questions, please. Jean-Christophe, Zogenix publicly stated a peak sales expectation of $1 billion. I know you don't like giving peak sales expectations. But can you at least characterize whether that's a view you share or given your leadership position in epilepsy. Is that something you feel that as a company, you can do better than $1 billion? Secondly, for Charl, on FINTEPLA, currently annualizing around $100 million. It does feel like the net additions are slowing. I don't know whether that's COVID or the dose cap or the high cost. And when you look at the clinical data, the drug looks very differentiated in Dravet, perhaps less than LGS.
So maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about the commercial potential in the different indications and bridging that gap from current levels to peak sales. And then lastly, Sandrine, I'll try again on the previous question. Just can you give us any sense.
I know you don't want to go into the details, but should we be thinking modest accretion when you come in terms of interpreting your comments for 2023, I suppose, like Jean-Jacques just trying to understand how much of that Zogenix cost base you can strip out.
I realize you probably don't want to go there, but at least just can you characterize whether it's modest or significant accretion that you're thinking about for '23?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe Tellier,  UCB SA - CEO & Executive Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter, thank you very much for your question. And on the first one, first, just to make sure that I'm clear on that. It's not that I don't like to provide peak sales. I love to provide peak sales. The question is the moment and when we can provide peak sales. So I'm sorry to maybe create a bit of frustration here because I would like to test your patience. And first, we need to close this deal then we need to continue to see where the product is.
But traditionally, after a few months of presence in the market, this is for us the moment where we would probably provide the peak sales. And so then you will have the ability to compare with what Zogenix has put in their plan before.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Peter, thank you for your question. Let me start with, first, at least our insights into the launch performance. What we see certainly is largely fitting the thesis of where they're going in terms of their stated peak sales. We know that during the pandemic, there has been a dampening of access, for example, to some of the clinics. And so launching a new product like this during a pandemic environment is not optimal.
And so that has probably slightly dampened the growth in early parts of the launch. But overall, we see this -- the feedback from a key opinion leader perspective is the clinical profile, the efficacy profile is really stellar in that sense, so very high commitment from physicians to use it there.
So we feel confident with that sort of peak sales future potential that has also been stated by the company. I would say just on your -- on the point of access to an extent. And in this case, we see really no restrictions at this point, especially in the U.S. market, of course, with patients having access to reimbursement. In the case of Dravet, of course, very strong profile and the clinical evidence supports that very strongly.
In LGS, we know that there's a subpopulation that is more severe that have severe seizures, as Iris had mentioned. And today, also within the access environment in the U.S. FINTEPLA will be in a third step edit. So we factor that into our business model in the sense that it will be first standard of care then Epidiolex and then FINTEPLA in the LGS population where the population in that subset is really suffering from severe seizures.
So we see a very clear position in LGS based on the efficacy profile, but of course, the subset of that population. Hopefully, that answers your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And on the last one, I may create additional frustration -- sorry about this, but I'm sure it's not (inaudible) to have to close first and come back and give you a better view on the expected accretion. We will work after closing on the best integration plan with the Zogenix team and we'll be able to provide better guidance on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is coming from Jeroen van den Bossche, and he is coming from KBC. Jeroen, please unmute yourself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeroen van den Bossche,  KBC Securities -     [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So thank you, everybody, and congratulations on the potential acquisition. And I must say, we also see it as a very good strategic fit -- thanks, everybody else for the questions because they were also a little bit on the list before from me. Maybe a question going forward. How would you see the split to understand you can't really share the peak sales, but considering the patient population in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome seems high and then in Dravet.
Can we expect that the sales split for these indications will be similarly affected or is pricing going to be significantly different between the 2 indications? And can you share some light on that to the future?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you, Jeroen. I think just to be consistent there, we will, I think, have a more broader and deeper discussion on peak sales, and that split between patient populations once we have a post-closing stage, and we can really go deeper into how we see the potential in each of those patient populations. So comfortable to come back to that at the right moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeroen van den Bossche,  KBC Securities -     [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And maybe one follow-up question. the other assets in the pipeline, is it the idea to also go and commercialize that as it seems to be somewhat of a different indication or are you more going after the type of deal like with chasing Novartis there? If you can share obviously something around that or your ideas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I can start there. But again, I think our clear strategic fit, of course, is Fintepla and the indications and what it will bring to our epilepsy portfolio. We need a bit more time to assess the pipeline in more detail and we'll come back on choices we may think there. But at this stage, our thesis of why is really built around the indications of Fintepla, and that's where we will focus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is coming from Keyur from Goldman Sachs. And he sent me an e-mail. So the first one is, can you talk to your confidence in potential competition concerns around this transaction given UCB's dominance in the broader epilepsy field? And in particular, the ability to close by the end of the second quarter 2022.
Second, how should we think about the incremental financial flexibility post this transaction for UCB in areas of strategic interest? Jean-Christophe, Charl for the first and second Sandrine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm happy to start on the antitrust. Of course, we have taken a careful view of this, but I would just state very clearly that today, in our portfolio, we have no indication for Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut, any of our assets. So it's really -- there is no overlap of indications. And so we see this very much as a separate solution for a separate patient population and feel, therefore, very confident on the clearance and the potential to clear this deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe Tellier,  UCB SA - CEO & Executive Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I would agree. And I would just refer to the first slide that Iris mentioned in a sense where you see the split in the current treatment of epilepsy, where you get 70% of the patients populations with treated and controlled with certain treatment, and we are looking at a subpart of the 30% who are refractory.
And this is really the sub part of this population that we are currently addressing potentially with Fintepla. So I think that there is, from an indication standpoint, from a focus standpoint, from the size of the populations and the definition of the population from our perspective, it's a complement and addition that give us confidence on the closing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the second question, Antje, on the financial -- the balance sheet aspects. I'd like to highlight the fact that we maintain strategic balance sheet flexibility, including upon closing. Before the transaction, we are entering this transaction on the leverage, which is at a level below one time.
We have delevered since the Ra Pharma acquisition. And so the combination of this transaction on the balance sheet, we will still maintain the strategic flexibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is also coming online via e-mail, and no I did not make up this order. It's coming from Diana Na from Berenberg. Her first question is in terms of the consensus sales ramp for Fintepla, consensus is looking for roughly $700 million by 2025. How realistic do you think the sales ramp is, in particular, in context to the competitor product from Jazz?
And second, with respect to the financing, how should we think about the split between cash versus the new term loan and the interest rate assumption?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for that question, Diana. And here, I would again emphasize that we would certainly, post closing, come back to a more deeper discussion around consensus by 2025 and be very happy to go deeper into also the patient populations and how that is constructed. So stay tuned to that time frame, and we will come back in more detail on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandrine Dufour,  UCB SA - Executive VP & CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And on your second question, Diana, upon closing, the purchase price will be financed out of this new USD 800 million term loan and the rest is the available cash, which is on our balance sheet. As for your question on the costs, the new loan terms are in line with the Ra Pharma loan. Now if I look at the average expected rate over 5 years, I insist on the 5 years, the average is on 2.25%. I'm very precise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Sandrine. The next question is coming from Ivan Strugatsky. Please state your company name and unmute yourself, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ivan Strugatsky,  Stran Capital -     [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ivan Strugatsky, Stran Capital. Just a question on this acquisition and maybe a broader strategy of UCB. -- kind of historically, at least part of the investment community thought about the epilepsy franchise as more second priority for UCB and if we look at the pipeline, the expected revenues from other indications from other franchises been expect to be much higher than from epilepsy.
So I'm just curious kind of beyond Zogenix transaction. What type of activities in epilepsy should we expect from UCB either on R&D front or on the acquisition? Would it be again, as you mentioned in your slide, something in the unmet medical need or maybe it would be in the broader epilepsy where -- Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe Tellier,  UCB SA - CEO & Executive Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Ivan, for the question. I think you have already a piece of answer in 2 components, right? One was the what Charl said with you. I mean we always have been committed, and we will continue to be committed to be in a leading position in epilepsy.
Now the evaluation of the pipeline is the one that I would like maybe to highlight to further answer your question. It's true that we have seen an evolution in research in epilepsy, right? During the last maybe 20, 30 years, it was mainly symptomatic treatment to try to get mainly through channel blockers, getting access to a treatment that can -- with chronic therapy provide seizures to happen on a regular base in general epileptic population.
Through this research, we have had great success ourselves, I mean, Keppra, Vimpat, Briviact, are few of them for us and others. We are moving now towards a different focus, which is more towards more specific subpopulations of epileptic patients, which are refractory patients today, meaning that with the current standard of care, it's difficult to treat and very difficult to treat.
So we are focusing more internally, and we will continue to look at potential external inorganic opportunity there to try to complement what we have and to try to focus on more disease-specific subpopulations where we can provide more disease type of modifications more than just symptomatic treatment.
So I would like you to continue to think about UCB in these terms, leadership in epilepsy and focusing on different types of patients populations moving forward. And I think Zogenix to that extent is a great example and illustration of this evolution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is coming from Charles Pitman from Redburn. Can you please talk a bit about the commercial efforts of UCB will adapt to promoting Fintepla given its controlled use status? And how are you thinking about the hurdles to Zogenix sales outpacing consensus expectations.
Is it just a matter of applying UCB's superior marketing power? Could you remind us of the key Zogenix catalysts that we should be watching out for both Fintepla and MT1621? How are you thinking about the antitrust regulations? Have you had any early conversations with the regulators? I think there's a lot of Charl in it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Antje. So on your question, Charles, on the sales perspective, of course, we have a global footprint in all the key markets, and we have very strong relationships on all levels from tertiary centers to secondary to and also, in some cases, primary care coverage.
So we feel we have a very strong presence where patients with Dravet or LGS are presenting themselves. Of course, we will work very closely with our partners at Zogenix to collaborate and ensure that we continue to see this momentum that is there today in their launch to not be disrupted and continue that momentum going forward.
But we feel in the mid- to- midterm, one sales organization that is really focused on delivering this entire portfolio based on the customer needs is how we would continue to evolve and build our leadership potential there. We will -- as we said, really, the focus remains on Dravet and LGS, and that is also an important next milestone, which is the LGS approval that we would expect in the U.S. and then in Europe, that will follow later.
So those -- that will be, I would say, important triggers. When we look at the rest of the pipeline, as we said a bit earlier on the call, our time -- we will take our time post closing to evaluate each of those options in the pipeline and come back with a more specific view or valuation of what we see in that pipeline.
But today, the focus -- and the emphasis of the deal is very much on the indications that are either commercially now available or will be in short term approved in the market. I think I've covered all the questions, Antje, if there's anything else that I missed let me know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He also wanted to know a little bit more about -- he's trying -- pushing his luck again on the antitrust question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think we -- as we said, we remain confident that there is no major obstacle. And in this Q2, Q3 time frame is when we believe we will get clearance. So that's how we remain confident at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly. So we -- I just reconfirm we are expecting closing by the end of the second quarter of this year. Peter Verdult is asking another question because he has been prompted. So Peter, I allow you to ask a second question. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Verdult,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is on behalf of an investor on the call, they've asked me to put this question to you, Jean-Christophe, can you give any information about the background or process leading up to the transaction. Just give us a sense as to how competitive the process was or exclusive. I realize you can't go into the gory details, but if you could at least characterize the background and then the process, that would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe Tellier,  UCB SA - CEO & Executive Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I don't know how I can characterize this. What I can say is that we are very pleased to be in front of you today. And the fact that we are in front of you today means that we have reached an agreement with unanimous support of the 2 boards.
And that has been our main objective. And that's the situation we are in. So on fact based, this is the only thing that I can share with you. From what I have seen from what I have known, I'm very pleased with the way we have engaged with Zogenix to reach this agreement and very pleased for both of us where we are now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Okay. I have another question from Wimal from Bernstein, and he wants to go again into the price point topic. Given the significantly higher price point of Fintepla versus Epidiolex, how will UCB approach commercialization? Is there an efficacy angle you can point to that justifies a higher price point, particularly in LGS, given the headlines on efficacy are not too dissimilar and some of the secondary endpoints failed to reach statistical significancy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for that question. I would emphasize that, of course, we have also done our homework on pricing. And today, we are very confident with the price levels that are there. The access is not denied to patients today, and there is a very clear protocol of how patients are being given access in a sense through a step edit process as many would be familiar within the U.S.
And in that case, as we mentioned also with LGS, there's a third line positioning today in the access environment, a 3-step edit process. So through that process, the reimbursement is guaranteed in a sense for these patients who really need the treatment to have severe seizure manifestations. So we see today no access restrictions. Of course, we will also work with the associations and with the payers to ensure patient assistance where needed. But from that perspective, we are very confident for the current pricing assumptions that are there that also have been set by the company, of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you very much. I think this is what I have on my list. I don't see a hand raised. (Operator Instructions) And I have Chaim Davis raised his hand or her hand, sorry. And please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chaim Davis,   -     [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I'm just wondering why this deal happened before LGS approval? And if you feel that there's any risk to LGS approval, which happens later in the quarter? And then the second question, is just if you can sort of give any commentary if this was just a meeting of the minds between the 2 companies or whether or not this was, how competitive a process this was.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iris, do you want to comment on the LGS regulatory path?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iris Low-Friedrich,  UCB SA - Chief Medical Officer, Head of Development & Medical Patient Value Practices and Executive VP    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Based on the information that we have seen and based on, of course, what's in the public domain, there is currently no concern around the approval in the U.S. And of course, this is in the hands of FDA, not in our hands. So I can only speak to what you would expect in the regulatory process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And just in case as there has been some confusion among others, the CVR is linked to LGS approval as an orphan drug designation in Europe. It's not linked to the United States. Just if there is some confusion. And then I have a last question. Can -- from Richard Parkes, Exane BNP Paribas. Can you talk about stay time on drug in trials and in the market and tolerability.
Obviously, the ability to stay on drug for a long time has been one of the main drivers for Vimpat success. Zogenix shares sold off aggressively when the LGS data reported, given the data was viewed as underwhelming. Can you help us understand what the market got wrong there?
Last but not least, is base case that generics launch immediately post orphan drug exclusivity? I note that there are patents well beyond. So I was just wondering about your confidence they will delay generic launches further. Iris, could you start.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iris Low-Friedrich,  UCB SA - Chief Medical Officer, Head of Development & Medical Patient Value Practices and Executive VP    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, if I may provide a physician's perspective, right? So on LGS, first of all, these patients suffer heavily and these patients need medication and these patients are not controlled with what is available for them. So new options are necessary. The overall efficacy on the primary endpoint and also on the secondary endpoints in the LGS trial is on par with the other approved medicines in that space, right?
So what we have seen was a 20% superiority on drop seizures over placebo, and that's very much in line with what has been seen with other medicines as well. Charl mentioned it, and I've tried to indicate it as well, generalized tonic-chronic seizures are a very important seizure in these patients and also the seizures that are associated more with sudden death of epilepsy.
And there is very promising compelling results on this subpopulation in the LGS study. And last but not least, the LGS study included patients, about 30%, who were failures on Cannabidiol. So particular need where one of the more recent approved medicines did not provide a satisfactory treatment effect. So I just wanted to provide a physician context around the LGS results because I really believe that this will be a much needed addition to the still quite limited treatment armamentarium of the pediatric epileptologists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much, Charl, Jean-Christophe, you want to follow on the orphan drug exclusivity piece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charl Van Zyl,  UCB SA - Executive VP of Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can just again comment that what we know today is 2027 as the period of exclusivity, and that's also how we've, of course, assumed that in our valuation. It's too early to really comment if there's any potential beyond that. So I think we would leave it at 2027.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jean-Christophe Tellier,  UCB SA - CEO & Executive Director    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, perfect. I have nothing to add, exactly that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Antje Witte,  UCB SA - Head of IR    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So thank you very much, dear all. We have come to the end of the call and to the end of the question list. Thank you very much for your attendance. For any further questions, you know where to find the UCB Investor Relations team. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Take care.
