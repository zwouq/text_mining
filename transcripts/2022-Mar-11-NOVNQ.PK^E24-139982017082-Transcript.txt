--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining our call this morning. We have invited you all to join us as just a couple of hours ago, Novan announced what we believe is tremendously exciting news. In short, we have closed on the acquisition of EPI Health and effective today have emerged as a fully integrated specialty dermatology company. We now have marketed products and a proprietary R&D platform technology, which will fuel organic growth for Novan. We are well positioned to detail our SB206 or KINSOLUS of approved product. And we're in the position to tout an experienced dermatology commercial platform. We now have established healthcare relationships as well as product launch experience.
Importantly, I am proud to say that this transaction has created a pharmaceutical engine that has the capabilities to discover, research, develop innovative therapies and bring medications to patients with dermatological needs. Without a doubt, we have established an accelerated path for Novan, putting the 2 core pieces of a pharmaceutical company together. We now have an established commercial infrastructure with an existing revenue stream.
I want to take just a few minutes to review the Novan R&D organization. For those of you new to the Novan story, our NITRICIL technology enables us to store large amounts of nitric oxide gas in a stable, solid form by chemically loading it on a macro molecule or polymer. The advantages of our technology include tunability, stability, high storage capacity and targeted delivery. We believe that our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form on-demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of different diseases. We're currently planning for 3 potential NDAs before the end of 2024 with 3 different product candidates for the treatments of molluscum contagiosum, acne and SARS CoV-2.
I mentioned the pharmaceutical engine. This is truly representative of our near-term opportunities as well as our ability to leverage our platform technology to continue in the mid and long term to fuel our pipeline and ultimately, additional commercial opportunities. Each product candidate has its own compelling and addressable market globally and domestically with Novan's pending solutions. You'll see there at the bottom of the slide, meeting different current medical needs and potentially millions of patients in need.
Our lead product candidate is SB206 or Berdazimer gel 10.3% and hopefully, KINSOLUS. It's a potential topical prescription treatment for molluscum contagiosum. And in 2021, we reported what I have referred to as robustly positive top line results from our pivotal Phase III study.
Molluscum is prevalent primarily in children ages 1 to 14. And there currently is no FDA-approved treatment. It's highly contagious and again, no prescription solution. and dermatologists and pediatricians remain concerned with the tolerability of today's office-based procedures. There are approximately 1.3 million new cases a year in the U.S. alone, and the standard practice of care is within office procedures that are often painful.
Quickly, our Phase III trial known as B-SIMPLE4, was the catalyst for a transformational year for Novan in 2021. We demonstrated clinical and statistical evidence of efficacy with our primary and secondary endpoints. So we're now preparing the NDA and are targeting submission in the fourth quarter of 2022 for this year. As normal course of business, next quarter, we'll be conducting our pre-NDA meeting with the agency and completing customary stability testing of GMP batches of our drug substance and drug product.
So now let's switch gears and discuss our newly wholly-owned commercial subsidiary, EPI Health. Many times before on these calls, I've shared our theme of planning for success. And as we've been planning towards the potential launch of SB206. I've also shared with you that we will be carefully and strategically evaluating scenarios to build or partner or acquire a commercial solution. Well, with confidence, I can say that we have identified a path and the best and most compelling path that delivers value, and that was to acquire an established business.
EPI checked all of our boxes. They have invested most importantly, in their people, in their products and in their processes. They have expertise across the board, market access from payers to patients. They've had success in sales targeting across dermatology indications. And finally, they've demonstrated that they know how to launch new and even older products. As I mentioned, EPI Health has an established presence in the dermatology community with a strong specialty pharmacy network and strong relationships and engagement with KOLs and key customers.
As a combined entity, we now have a portfolio of 6 products with our most recent launch in 2021 with Wynzora, and we're actively promoting 4 of those products across 4 indications that include psoriasis, rosacea, acne and dermatosis, really 4 top dermatology indications. And we're currently covering 42 territories in the U.S., with plans already to expand later in 2022.
And we have a team that will be ready for SB206 if and when approved. A lot of times, strategic planning and modeling has gone into this decision and it all reaffirms our collective teams and our Board's high enthusiasm for this transaction. EPI Health has a strong leadership team, which complements our Novan team. John Donofrio with his GSK, Merz and TrialCard experience has been appointed to be Novan's EVP and Chief Operating Officer, while continuing in his role as the President of EPI Health.
Jointly, this new team brings -- just this leadership team brings over 100 years of pharma experience, and most of that is dermatology. So together, Novan plus EPI Health, a Novan company have created a specialty dermatology company. We're focused on developing and marketing innovative therapeutic products for skin diseases. We have an experienced leadership team across both groups. We have integrated capabilities now from bench to bedside. We've established a commercial platform in the top 4 derm markets. We have a proprietary platform to fuel future growth.
Now the terms of the acquisition are that we have a total upfront purchase price of $27.5 million and that's $11 million in cash from Novan and a seller's note from the evening post group of $16.5 million, which is a 24-month term. The agreement then includes earn-outs up to an additional maximum of $23.5 million and those were a certain milestones are achieved by the EPI Health subsidiary of Novan. And these milestones may be paid in -- sorry, paid in cash or stock but it's really primarily at the discretion of Novan. There's only 1 that's cash only. So it's really our discretion as those milestones are hit.
So there's tremendous value in EPI Health. And really, it's both tangible and intangible. So here, I've just focused on the tangible. They delivered operating revenue in 2021 of approximately $18 million. There's current and future value, in our opinion, in EPI Health assets and infrastructure. And we have a Novan subsidiary that will deliver positive operating contribution. Now let's not forget that in addition, we have our priority -- but in addition -- sorry, to our priority dermatology platform, we have several other product candidates in the wings. We have this full technology platform based on NITRICIL that's poised to fuel future growth for Novan beyond the 2024 submissions that I mentioned earlier.
So in summary, Today, Novan completed its acquisition of EPI Health. The 2 together are a potential force multiplier in the dermatology industry. We have a readymade, established and successful sales team for the launch of SB206 or KINSOLUS, if approved. We have an experienced dermatology commercial platform with cost synergies between our existing portfolio of products and potential new products. We are Novan and EPI Health, a Novan company. We are a specialty dermatology company focused on developing and marketing innovative therapeutic products for skin diseases. I am personally thrilled with today's news and the future of Novan.  
So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Oren Livnat with H.C. Wainwright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, I was on mute. Not used to getting -- being first in the queue. Congrats on -- it looks like a pretty pivotal move for you guys. Looks like a no-brainer, I guess, as far as bridging to or beyond the SB206 launch that we've been focused on for a long time. So can you just help us understand first, just big picture strategy, I guess I kind of tip my hand already there. Do you view this as primarily a way to build a commercial sales force in the most, I guess, efficient manner, as you mentioned, in terms of cost and return? Or do you view yourselves as like a diversified commercial operation post molluscum launch? I guess what I'm really asking is if you had to rank your focus 2, 3 years down the road, is Molluscum the main driver in your view? Or is this business going to be contributing several years out materially on the revenue side. I guess it was a garbled way to ask that.
And I guess just fold it into that is just what is the trajectory of this existing commercial business? I mean, obviously, the multiple you paid on $18 million is quite modest. So I'm wondering what the trajectory of the existing business is?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you -- thank you, Oren.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, I haven't had my coffee yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't drink coffee. So this is really tough today. So the trajectory is that we have a commercial engine -- we don't have to build a commercial arm. So you mentioned that first because we have a commercial arm now. And it is out there. It is doing a great job. It's generating revenue. We have a great sales team that I'm looking forward to meeting later this afternoon for the first time. And we -- there is, yes, several years of revenue with the current products and then holding in our own molluscum when that -- when that is approved. So it's just a really beautiful marriage in terms of timing. So obviously, the 4 products being promoted currently will be in the bag and then when and the time that molluscum, SB206 comes out, we'll put that in the bag. Our team is dermatology. We still need some access to pediatricians as we know. But this is a great, great fit in terms of their own base. We now, our commercial organization having products in the bag and the ability to then make those decisions when and if molluscum is approved and fitting that right in the bag with the others and focusing at the time.
So hopefully, that answers your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. And I guess, just more specifically, I can pull prescription data for sure, for those products. And it looks like RHOFADE is doing quite well. But what we don't have visibility on, I guess, is behind the scenes, the actual economics, I think you mentioned $18 million in sales. Is that growing going forward or is that a stable business declining?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We do expect it to grow. Absolutely. So we expect that to grow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Aschoff with ROTH Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Matthew Aschoff,  ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on the acquisition. Paula and John, any sense of when this would be accretive?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John M. Gay,  Novan, Inc. - CFO & Corporate Secretary    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think if you look at -- if you want to look at operating contribution or EBIT as we kind of look at it, I will say I would look at it in 2 different ways. One is when it will be positively adding to contribution, we think that will be in the relatively short term. But the other way that we can look at it is thinking about the cost synergies that we're going to save from the expenditures that we have forecasted in our previous model with respect to how we were going to commercialize.
So I think there's -- if you look at operating contribution, I think there's a couple of ways to look at it, right? It's just your standard profitability. But if you also layer that on to cost synergies that we get from the activities that just our new sales force will be executing against and how that can really facilitate and bolster the 206 activity, it's something that's really advantageous to the company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Matthew Aschoff,  ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what was EPIs expenses or at least the bottom line last year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John M. Gay,  Novan, Inc. - CFO & Corporate Secretary    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I think -- so you'll see, Jonathan, that we did file as part of the 8-K that we did this morning, the financials and the pro forma on a stand-alone basis of this entity. So I'll point you to those. I would say that looking back historically, is a data point. However, it's probably not indicative of future results. Obviously, they're going to be, again, cost synergies with respect to overhead, et cetera, in addition to the not, I would say, replacement cost with respect to what we had forecasted for other service providers around the commercial route. But I'll have to say, Jonathan, I don't know -- certainly, you can take a look at the financials that have been filed with the 8-K, but I would say that's a data point and not indicative of what we expect going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Matthew Aschoff,  ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. How does this affect the acquisition of products and the sales force? How does this affect your Syneos relationship?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I've already reached out to the Syneos this morning. As you know, we were -- we had incremental scopes of work. And so this does not affect their backlog at all because what we have already signed up for with Syneos for the next few months, we will continue with that and look to continue the partnership just in a different way. They've been a great partner to us but the bulk of what we have with EPI Health being our sales force, we won't need the actual sales force, but there's a lot of planning and preparation and whatnot that they've been supporting us and we'll continue some of that work on through this year and perhaps even into next year. But -- so we're still working with Syneos. And I've spoken with Alistair and I have exchanged e-mails this morning the CEO. So he's happy for us and just wants to work with us on the path forward, which will include them and EPI Health.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Matthew Aschoff,  ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So you're still going to get what you paid for with Syneos. You haven't paid for stuff you're not going to get as a result of the EPI acquisition. Is that accurate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John M. Gay,  Novan, Inc. - CFO & Corporate Secretary    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because we were very careful as we signed up for pieces of work that I wasn't signing up for anything that I didn't feel like we were going to still need as I was even progressing this discussion. So.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Matthew Aschoff,  ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. And you -- and it sounds like you're not going to deemphasize any of your programs, but are you truly not going to deemphasize any of your development as a result of this acquisition?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are currently not planning to -- we've -- most of our development program, we've said we needed additional funding to move forward. So right now, we still are progressing with everything we've had in our previous plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John M. Gay,  Novan, Inc. - CFO & Corporate Secretary    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan, and also add to that. Again, Paula used the term marriage. I do kind of like that term because if you look at the platform that they've built with regards to commercializing dermatological products, without an underlying technology or an R&D platform. And you look at Novan, who is the exact opposite, where we, obviously, prior till today did not have a commercial presence. But we did have a technology platform that has a lot of potential. And I think that's why it's such a great combination. Paula often jokes 1 plus 1 equals 3 sometimes. And we think that this is certainly an opportunity for that to present itself because it fits so nicely together. There are no redundancies in this acquisition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Kim with Cantor Fitzgerald.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jennifer M. Kim,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Large Cap and Biopharma Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on the news today. So I have 2 questions for myself. The first is, I think during the call, you mentioned you have plans to further expand the sales force this year or next year. And I was wondering how much additional expansion are you thinking if needed? And is that more to do with SB206 in mind? Or is there some additional expansion just for the current products?
And then my second question is related to what prior speakers have asked, as you position yourself as a commercial stage specialty derm company, could we see some greater focus on maybe you eyeing additional products to leverage the sales force you now have in the near future ahead of SB206 or how are you thinking about maximizing what you have now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jennifer. On the first, yes, we do have plans to expand the sales force that was in our modeling, and we'll expand that over the next 2 quarters. And we will move to cover at least 50 territories, and that is because of obviously, our intent to increase and maximize the value of this as John mentioned. So we're excited about that plan and moving forward. 
In terms of being a commercial specialty derm company, we have received interest and companies bringing interest to us in terms of eyeing additional products in the past over the past couple of years, actually. I think now we have the time, the energy, maybe not the energy today, John, but the time to really look at those more closely and see if there are opportunities to fit into our bag better than what is there or otherwise. So we will certainly look at things opportunistically. If I answered the question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from the line of John Vandermosten with Zacks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John D. Vandermosten,  Zacks Small-Cap Research - Senior Biotechnology Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the acquisition. The sales force right now and who they are visiting, are they visiting the molluscum prospects already because you talked about regions and geographies that they're going to be targeting. But are they talking to the right people as well in those geographies because -- yes, just -- I'll just leave it there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean they are calling on dermatologists. And I think you know from molluscum, we'll call on dermatologists, pediatric dermatologists and eventually the pediatricians. But as we've said on other calls, the pediatricians will hit more with digital. So we weren't really planning a lot there anyway. So I haven't looked at every individual where exactly, but most of the dermatologists are seeing molluscum patients. There are only a few I've heard of who don't want molluscum in their waiting room but mostly -- most dermatologists who are going to see acne and rosacea patients and specifically acne because they're younger, a lot of the acne patients are 9 to 18 and that -- so there'll be practices that are seeing children, and that's the main thing. So I think there's a lot of overlap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John D. Vandermosten,  Zacks Small-Cap Research - Senior Biotechnology Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then on the territories, I'm assuming those are all in the United States?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, they are. But we do have rights with some of these products outside the U.S. So that is something that we will look in the future to seeing if we can seize that opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John D. Vandermosten,  Zacks Small-Cap Research - Senior Biotechnology Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then on the products, how are they acquired? I mean, I wasn't quite sure if EPI had any R&D operations or they just acquire generics or they just partner with others who developed it and then they commercialize it. What is their strategy in terms of -- or I guess your strategy now in terms of acquiring new assets or the ones that are already acquired?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So EPI Health was really founded in 2017 and through an acquisition of a product and then through the last 3 or 4 years have acquired other products. So they're all asset acquisitions except Wynzora, which is a different licensing type agreement. So within MC2 therapeutics. So they do not have any R&D, and that's why it's such a good fit because they don't have R&D. So the only way they would be able to fuel growth is through a different additional acquisition of assets. And so now this puts it together, and there's not as much pressure to acquire new assets to fill in when patents end, et cetera. So now we can fit that in with the Novan NITRICIL products. So good question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John D. Vandermosten,  Zacks Small-Cap Research - Senior Biotechnology Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then just the last one for me is on your manufacturing assets that you have. Will you be able to leverage them at all? You talked about some synergies. Is that part of the synergy that you can leverage with them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We don't think so. We have not figured that in, John, in terms of our -- they outsource manufacturing. We outsource part of our manufacturing, what we manufacture here is very specific to nitric oxide. So I don't think in manufacturing, we see any current synergies there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from the line of Kemp Dolliver with Brookline Capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Kemp Dolliver,  Brookline Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Director of Research & Senior Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I did have a chance to go through some of the financials in the filings. They had a soft Q4, I'm assuming that was probably COVID related. Has the business rebounded noticeably year-to-date?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John M. Gay,  Novan, Inc. - CFO & Corporate Secretary    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Yes, you're right, Kemp. I mean, they did have -- and just like everyone is trying to visit doctors and get scripts written an impact with COVID. And I think you see that if you look at the historicals and kind of where that's trending. But hopefully, we're coming out of that now. On to Paula's point, as we continue to add additional heads to the sales force, we think that trajectory is going up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Kemp Dolliver,  Brookline Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Director of Research & Senior Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And what's the composition of revenue by product? Is there any particular concentration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean I think -- I think we can share that one of -- I think it was Jonathan maybe who mentioned it in terms of looking at scripts, RHOFADE is probably -- is the highest revenue generator currently. The most recent launch was Wynzora just in last July so we're picking up steam there. Look forward to picking up more steam.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Kemp Dolliver,  Brookline Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Director of Research & Senior Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. And could you talk a little bit more about the synergies because you've hired some sales leadership, you're bringing on EPIs leadership. It looks like there will be some changes there. Are the cost savings anything we would notice given what you need to do with regard to adding reps and doing other things to build the business from here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So the synergies are really an external spend and not internal spend. So actually, the -- our sales team was really an [n of 2] and that really complements nicely in terms of the expertise of the individuals and the number of products that we have in the bag. So we'll be working through that integration, but we do not foresee any internal, if you will, cost synergies in the typical sense. Ours is, if you will -- the cost that we will be avoiding externally by having our own dedicated sales force.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chairman, President and CEO, Paula Brown Stafford, for any closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paula Brown Stafford,  Novan, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairwoman    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone for jumping on this call so quickly today. We're thrilled with our news and the future of Novan. So we look forward to keeping you posted over the next few months as we move through the integration phase. And thank you all, and have a great day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies 
may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety 
of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current 
expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ 
materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a 
number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically 
identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies 
may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or 
incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS,
OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS.
IN NO WAY DOES REFINITIV OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER
DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN
ANY EVENT TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S
