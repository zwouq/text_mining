Thank you, operator. This is Alex Dasalla, Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Collegium Pharmaceutical. I'd like to welcome you all this morning to our investor call to discuss Collegium's acquisition of BioDelivery Sciences International, known as BDSI, which we announced jointly in a press release issued earlier today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Alex. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Let me start by saying how excited we are to talk to you today about our proposed acquisition of BDSI, a company and management team that we respect and know very well.
This acquisition represents a major milestone in Collegium's journey to build a leading, diversified specialty pharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from serious medical conditions. I'd like to take a moment to congratulate BDSI for building a strong and diversified business, driven by their success with BELBUCA. I would also like to recognize my Collegium colleagues who have worked hard to get us to this day and thank them for their commitment to people living with serious medical conditions in the communities we serve.
I'm going to start today by discussing the strategic rationale for the proposed acquisition of BDSI. Colleen will then provide an overview of the transaction details. And following prepared remarks, we will open it up for Q&A.
2022 is a pivotal year for Collegium Pharmaceutical. We are laser focused on 2 critical priorities. The first is the renegotiation of contracts representing approximately 50% of all Xtampza ER prescriptions. We are absolutely committed to managing Xtampza gross to net to less than 65% beginning in January 2023. The second is the diversification of our portfolio through an accretive commercial stage, high synergy acquisition which will bolster our long-term durable growth and returns profile. When closed, BDSI will be the second commercial stage high-synergy acquisition that we have executed since 2020. Our prior acquisition of the Nucynta Franchise was financially transformational for our organization, and we are confident that the proposed acquisition of BDSI will propel Collegium to the next level.
BDSI was the highest priority target for our team as it threads the needle on all of our stated business development objectives. The industrial logic of this combination is compelling, and we believe it will create significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, the acquisition will diversify Collegium's financial profile by doubling the number of commercial stage assets. Importantly, the combined portfolio will be comprised of 2 durable growth drivers and Xtampza ER and BELBUCA, the Nucynta franchise and Symproic service contributors to the top and bottom lines and Elyxyb represents a launch opportunity. It expands Collegium's portfolio of differentiated and complementary pain solutions. Xtampza ER, BELBUCA and the Nucynta Franchise are distinctly positioned and sourced from different parts of the pain market.
We are confident that we can grow Xtampza ER and BELBUCA and maximize the contribution of the Nucynta Franchise and Symproic. It aligns to the operational strengths and capabilities of our organization and leverages our core cost structure. We expect this to be a highly synergistic acquisition, and we anticipate that integration will be seamless. And it establishes a foothold in neurology, which is a strategic market adjacency that we have prioritized. We plan on taking a focused and phased approach to the Elyxyb launch.
2022 is off to an exciting start for Collegium Pharmaceutical. BDSI was our highest priority acquisition target. We believe that the logic for the transaction is clear and compelling, strategically and financially transformational for our organization and will create meaningful value for our shareholders.
I will now hand the call over to Colleen for a discussion of the transaction details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. First, let me also express my enthusiasm and excitement for this acquisition. Integration of BDSI, coupled with the actions we are taking on the Xtampza renegotiation in 2022 will significantly enhance the financial profile of Collegium going forward and position us strongly to build the Collegium of tomorrow.
I will now be moving to the transaction details. Under the terms of the agreement, Collegium will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of BDSI at the price of $5.60 per share, which represents a 54% premium to BDSI closing share price of $3.64 last Friday and a fully diluted equity value of approximately $604 million. The all-cash consideration will be funded by a combination of Collegium existing cash on hand and a new $650 million secured financing from Pharmakon. Those funds, in addition to BDSI estimated cash at close, which is expected to be approximately $100 million, will also be used to repay both Collegium and BDSI existing term loans from Pharmakon.
We were able to secure favorable terms from Pharmakon, which will provide a 4-year secured term loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 750 basis points and amortized over 4 years. As a result of the transaction, we estimate that our net leverage will be below 3x based on estimated fiscal year 2021 pro forma combined EBITDA, including run rate synergies. We expect that our significant cash flow generation post transaction will enable us to quickly deleverage and maintain a strong balance sheet to fund our growth going forward. The transaction is expected to close late in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions.
While we will hold off on providing specific details on synergies and timing related to our integration plans until after we close the transaction, we can provide some high-level assumptions. As Joe mentioned in his remarks, the transaction will be margin accretive day 1, driven by the diversification and expansion of our revenues. We will recognize operational synergies as we integrate BDSI and expect to achieve annual run rate synergies of at least $75 million based off of BDSI estimated 2021 operating expenses within 12 months post-closing.
We will generate additional cash flows from operations throughout the year, and our current near-term use of cash will be prioritized to building our cash balances to support future BD and debt pay down. We also have $42 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We are excited and energized by this acquisition, look forward to closing and rapidly moving forward with our integration plans. We can now open the call for your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Brandon Folkes from Cantor Fitzgerald.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brandon Richard Folkes,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the announcement. Three from me, if I may. Just how does this affect your overall reimbursement strategies going forward? Is this something you may review just given the different approaches with Xtampza and BELBUCA? Or should we just expect no changes?
Then maybe just any color on your thoughts and the diligence you did around the chemo research bench trial in April on BELBUCA?
And then lastly, if I may, can you say anything about any agreement received or around Elyxyb, you may launch Elyxyb? Should we still expect BDSI to continue with business as usual and launch the product? Or is there an agreement in the merger documents that they may hold off and you would launch the product initially?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brandon, this is Joe. I'm going to pass the payer strategy question to Scott, and then I'll come back to your next 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Dreyer,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Brandon. So first and foremost, anchored to our current portfolio, there's no change to our strategies for Xtampza and the Nucynta Franchise. And as a matter of fact, as Joe said in his prepared remarks, our #1 priority this year is the renegotiation of the contracts for Xtampza that represent 50% of our prescriptions, and we're committed to getting the gross to net below 65% beginning in January of '23.
About BELBUCA, I'm not going to speak to anything related to contracting for BELBUCA at this time until post deal close. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And Brandon, with regards to IP, I'm not going to get into any detail or discussion on today's call. I would say in the context of doing this deal, the Alvogen judgment was an important milestone. And certainly, the fact that we are executing the acquisition speaks to our belief and what it is we've learned through diligence. .
And as it pertains to Elyxyb, as I had said in my comments, one, we're excited about the strategic foothold that it creates for us in neurology, which has been an adjacency we prioritized, and we do intend to take a focused and phased approach to the Elyxyb launch. The final comment I would make there is wherever it is that we choose to play with Elyxyb, we will play to win.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brandon Richard Folkes,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And maybe one more follow-up, if I may, just sorry. On the Xtampza reimbursement negotiations this year, just given you'll have more scale at that stage, do you think that is -- helps you in those negotiations to get even more favorable terms than maybe you had previously commented on publicly?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Brandon, this is Joe. Good question. I would say when you think of the combined portfolio, the strategies being executed, where they're positioned in the market and the market baskets, they're entirely distinctly positioned. And so our focus will be with each of the products in the portfolio individually from a payer perspective. And one of the things we like is the distinct positioning of each product in the portfolio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brandon Richard Folkes,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And congratulations again on the acquisition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. We appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next question today is coming from David Amsellem from Piper Sandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Amsellem,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So just had a couple of questions. So Joe, you've mentioned gaining a foothold in neurology and I hate to ask this since you're just announcing a transaction, but I've got to ask it nonetheless. Can you talk about in more detail your level of interest in neurology, what kind of assets you might be looking at down the road? And would you take on R&D risk going forward now that you have a larger commercial footprint in place and also obviously are generating greater EBITDA. So that's number one.
And then number 2 is, Colleen, you mentioned share buyback, obviously realizing that you're going to be looking to delever rapidly. But can you talk about the role of share buybacks going forward? And what changes, if anything, regarding your thinking there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. David, this is Joe. Thanks for the questions. First off, with regards to this transaction, we believe that it bolsters our ability and strengthens the financial profile for the company. And of course, we're focused on really building a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company over time. Our immediate focus, as you'll appreciate, is really anchored to closing the transaction and seamlessly integrating BDSI into Collegium along with the renegotiation of the Xtampza ER contracts.
With regards to neurology specifically, as we've said, for the past several months, it was an adjacency that we have prioritized. I talked explicitly that any adjacent area, we would look at as a strategic beachhead upon which we would strive to build. And I think that the thing we like about Elyxyb is it puts us into neurology with a commercial footprint. And for today, that would be the extent of comments that I would share. But certainly, we are looking to build Collegium and grow the business over time. And we certainly like having that foothold in neurology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David, thanks for the question. On the share buyback, what I would say is a bit to echo Joe's comments. First of all, our priority is to get the transaction closed and then integrate effectively and efficiently. On the share buyback, as we've said previously, I like having that as a tool when there is a meaningful disconnect between our share price and the intrinsic value of the company. And so we will leverage that as a tool going forward when those opportunities arise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Amsellem,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's helpful. And if I may just sneak in a follow-up. Regarding the exclusivity runway for BELBUCA, we know that there is a settlement, I believe, with Teva, allowing for a generic in 2027. With that in mind, I guess, is it your view that there will be a limited competition generic environment for BELBUCA, particularly given the Alvogen outcome? I mean is that a fair way to think about it? And is that how you're sort of modeling the cash flow runway for BELBUCA?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, David, this is Joe. It's a really good question. For today, I'm not going to get into any details with regards to the IP associated with BELBUCA other than to say through our diligence, obviously, the fact that we're executing the transaction, we're confident on the path forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next question today is coming from Tim Lugo from William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Francis Lugo,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Co-Group Head of Biopharma Equity Research    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the deal. Can you talk about any FTC review estimates included within that Q1 close time frame? I know the pain and neurology markets are relatively fragmented and competitive, but does seem like the environment in Washington, D.C. may not be very amenable to pharma industry consolidation?
And then second, can you just talk about the net leverage 3x 2021 EBITDA multiple mentioned in the press release, in general. How comfortable are you around that leverage multiple? And are you looking to kind of rapidly work that down post close? Are you comfortable with maintaining that amount of leverage and potentially future deal?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. I'll talk about closing, and Colleen will address the questions on leverage. What I would say is that we expect to close late in the first quarter, obviously, to your question specifically, that's subject to all closing conditions, including receipt of the required regulatory approvals. And for completeness, the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of BDSI common stock. We do view the acquisition as complementary, and these products is distinctly positioned in different portions of the pain market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim, thanks for the question. On the leverage, yes, as I said in my remarks, we're going to be about 3x post-closing. And given the terms, we do expect with the additional operating cash we'll be generating from the combination will support fast pay down of net debt. It's a 4-year amortization with $100 million in the first year and the remaining split over the next 3 years. So you'll see that come down quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Francis Lugo,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Co-Group Head of Biopharma Equity Research    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And just following up on the amortization, given the schedule, it seems like you're still expecting it to be highly accretive on an earnings basis, not just an EBITDA basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Francis Lugo,  William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Co-Group Head of Biopharma Equity Research    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And congratulations on the deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question today is coming from Serge Belanger from Needham & Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serge D. Belanger,  Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would also like to offer my congrats on the deal. I guess first question on BELBUCA, for Joe. Products have been approved since 2015. Can you just talk about what stage of growth the product is in and its growth prospects? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, in November, you did 20% headcount reduction mostly to the sales force. Just curious where the sales force sizing should be post transaction in late first quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So thanks, Serge. I appreciate the questions. The first thing I would say is, one, we really respect the work that BDSI has done and what it is that they have accomplished with BELBUCA. We believe that BELBUCA adds a second growth driver to the Collegium portfolio. So our expectation is that BELBUCA will continue to grow and gain market share in the buprenorphine market specifically. And we think it's a good complement to the portfolio that we have.
With regards to headcount, the comment I would make there is when we restructured at the end of last year, the structure we moved to contemplated a commercial-stage high synergy acquisition. So as it pertains to our pain field force, we believe we are sized correctly to absorb this acquisition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next question is coming from Oren Livnat from H.C. Wainwright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A nice job getting your top target. Couple of questions sort of to build on some earlier ones. On the commercial side, you've highlighted there's obvious synergy operationally for this deal with $75 million in synergies. I'm just curious, you say your sales force is rightsized but also that these play in sort of different buckets. So can you just confirm that your existing sales force, your existing footprint can, in fact, cover both of those buckets with your, I guess, different patients. And in terms of just synergy, do you think you can do a different or better job than BDSI had done given, I guess, where trends are trajectory-wise now that you're -- do you think you bring any specific expertise to the table, whether it's patient access, on the promotional side of analytics, that may get sort of reinvigorate the trajectory of that? And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So Oren, this is Joe. I would just reiterate, when we did our restructuring, we sized our organization both from a home office and field perspective, contemplating a high synergy commercial stage acquisition. So we believe we're sized correctly. .
With regards to your second question, one, I would emphasize we really respect and believe BDSI has done an excellent job with BELBUCA over the past several years. We believe the asset is in a position to continue to grow, and we think that the plan that's in place is one that can seamlessly be integrated into our organization. So net-net, at the end of the day, we've added a second growth driver in our view to the organization and are very respectful of the great job that they've done with the asset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And just 2 more, if I may. I know you can't comment too much on IP and is not something you would talk about publicly maybe ever in detail. But it's not lost on me that both Teva with the settlement in 2027, and chemo, someone mentioned earlier on the call, years after filing don't have approval. This is clearly a difficult product to develop and manufacture and get approval for. So I'm just curious, do you potentially see even longer than 2027 runway given sort of how difficult it is? Teva might never be there despite that settlement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Oren, as you said, today is not a day in which I'm going to comment on anything associated with IP other than to say, through our diligence, I think the action of acquiring BDSI speaks to our view of the organization, inclusive of BELBUCA specifically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And I can sneak one last one. Unlike the -- you're being -- it sounds conservative on the initial launch phase targeted, I'm not sure exactly the wording. I built in significant spend for BDSI and launching their product, given their sort of more aggressive, I'd say, launch [language] or body language on that. Given that you've talked about flat OpEx for next year, stand-alone after rightsizing the company, is that OpEx number net of synergies still hold, do you think, with an Elyxyb launch, [any picture]?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So great question, Oren. What I would say is a couple of things. One, post the close of the transaction, we'll issue guidance that will give a perspective of how it is we look at the organization on a going-forward basis.
As it pertains to Elyxyb, what I would reiterate is we intend: one, we love the foothold in neurology; two, we will take a focused and phased approach to the launch; and the third thing is where it is that we choose to play. Initially, we will play to win.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oren Gabriel Livnat,  H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I look forward to guidance. So if you don't have a close by 4Q results, we're going to have to wait for a pro forma combined guidance, correct?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colleen Tupper,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct, Oren.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next question is coming from Greg Fraser from Truist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A quick follow-up on the pro forma sales organization, how many total reps do you expect to have a steady state? And how will those reps prioritize details for Xtampza versus BELBUCA?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Greg, that's a great question. This is Joe. I would say for today's call, we're going to not get into operational details or any specifics. I would just emphasize that the restructuring we had done in November, we believe we sized the field force to be able to absorb a commercial stage, high-synergy acquisition. And if it's okay, we'll hold off on any specifics until post the close.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Okay. And on Elyxyb, BDSI has been quite bullish on the long-term sales potential. Can you comment on how you view sales potential for that product or perhaps comment on how material that asset was to the deal value?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Greg, it's a great question. As you know, we don't give any peak sales guidance on any assets in our portfolio. That's a practice that we continue -- we will continue to hold to as Collegium. What I would say is the way we think about the Elyxyb opportunity, obviously, any launch is an exciting opportunity. The thing that I'm most excited about is the strategic foothold in neurology, which we had prioritized as an adjacent area that we're very interested in. And then we will take a focused and phased approach to the launch. We will learn as we go, but what I can assure you is where we choose to play, we will play to win.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregory Daniel Fraser,  Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood. Okay. And then just last question is, while the field will add material growth drivers for the next several years and provide significant cost synergies and cash flow, you're also adding a potential lift in 2027. Does this deal increase the urgency to bring in additional assets to help mitigate the Nucynta and BELBUCA in the 2026, '27 time frame?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph J. Ciaffoni,  Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Great question. From my perspective, what this deal does is it strengthens the immediate profile of the company, strengthens us financially and puts us in a position to continue to make the necessary investments to build and grow the business for the long term with a focus on creating shareholder value.
When you look at this acquisition for Collegium, this is our second commercial stage, high-synergy acquisition. If you look at Nucynta, I think you would concur this falls right into the wheelhouse of our organization, directly leverages our cost structure and capability, serves to strengthen us and puts us in a position post integration to really focus in on continuing to build the company.
