David M. Urso,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, David. The pending transaction presents an exciting opportunity for MEI and Infinity to advance 3 promising clinical stage oncology candidates. Each with the potential to be a transformative first-in-class therapy in patients with advanced diseases and for which the standard of care is inadequate. MEI brings 2 attractive early-stage therapeutic development candidates. An experienced team and a strong balance sheet to the combined company. We expect both of these candidates or cycled in combination with VENCLEXTA, and ME-344 in combination with Avastin to generate data around the end of this year with the potential to demonstrate safety and preliminary evidence of efficacy for Voruciclib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and for ME-344 in patients with colorectal cancer. Infinity's Eganelisib program would provide a Phase II candidate, representing a potential first-in-class immunotherapy, a PI3K Gamma inhibitor designed to reprogram macrophages and reduce immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment as well as an experienced drug development team.  
Each of these programs utilize understandings of biology to attempt to overcome resistance mechanisms of standard of care therapies and has preclinical and clinical data showing potential antitumor activity and mechanistic proof of concept for the combinations being evaluated. We will review some of this data during this presentation but I'd like to highlight the recently announced early data from the Voruciclib program. 
Last month, we reported promising clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia or B-cell malignancies. Administered Voruciclib alone and add the initial dose level in combination with venetoclax. Early safety data was also consistent with our prior experience. We view this as very encouraging and look forward to additional data.  
Beyond the diversification of our pipeline and supportive data generated to date, the pending merger leverages our company public infrastructures build a great team and has projected starting capital of about $100 million of closing, which we expect funds operations through mid-2025. We anticipate that this funding would enable us to move each of these programs forward in clinical development and to clinical data over the next 6 to 18 months. The combined team includes significant industry experience between me, Rob and Stefan Coloso. As mentioned, Rob will serve as CMO; and Stefan, our CFO, and together, this provides a highly experienced and knowledgeable core team to lead the successful advancement of our programs and business.  
Rob joined Infinity as CMO in September of 2021 from BMS and Celgene. We're focused on immuno-oncology drug development, including leadership roles on CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitor programs. Prior to that, he was at Eli Lilly for over 12 years. His expertise in drug development, coupled with his familiarity with immuno-oncology will continue to be invaluable as we shape the clinical programs. Stephan, prior to rejoining Infinity in August of 2021 as its CSO was at Ipsen Biosciences as VP, Global Head of Oncology, external innovation. During his earlier work at Infinity, he held increasing roles of responsibility ultimately leading the company's early discovery and pipeline expansion efforts through internal R&D and business development. As for myself, I was appointed at MEI's CEO earlier this month as part of our previously announced transition plan, replacing Dan Gold, who remains on the board. I joined MEI in 2014 as SVP, Head of Corporate Development and General Counsel.  
In 2018, I was appointed as COO. Prior to that, I was COO and General Counsel with Tioga Pharmaceuticals, a privately held drug development companys actually founded in 2005, while I was a principal of the venture capital for Forward Ventures. Before that, I worked in corporate development at the genomics company Gaming Sciences, and was an attorney in the corporate securities and licensing groups at Wilson Sonsini including Forward. 
The composition of our Board will change upon the approval of the proposed transaction. Importantly, Dan's experience and the experience of Adeline Perkins, the CEO of Infinity, will continue to be leveraged. And here you can see the composition of the remainder of the Board with (inaudible) as Chair. I'm very much looking forward to working with our new team, and we've already started to work together to ensure a smooth transition. Our integration planning has gone very well. As I've noted, the combined company will have 3 clinical stage oncology drug candidates in development. We will go into more detail shortly on the programs each of which addresses a clear medical need and represents significant market opportunity. 
Briefly, Eganelisib is planned to be evaluated in combination with KEYTRUDA in a controlled Phase II clinical study for the potential treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, starting in the third quarter of this year. Initial safety and PFS data from the planned Phase II study is expected in the second half of 2024. Vorciclob is currently being evaluated in a Phase Ib study exploring dose and schedule in patients with AML and B-cell malignancies as a single agent and in combination with (inaudible). The ongoing Phase Ib study is expected to report initial combination data around the end of this year. ME-344 is to be evaluated in a Phase I study in combination with Avastin in patients with relapsed colorectal cancer, which is expected to begin enrollment imminently. Data from the Phase Ib study to support opening enrollment in an additional cohort are also expected around the end of this year. So by the end of next year, our plan calls for Eganelisib also to have initial safety, MPFS data from a Phase II study and for Voruciclib and ME-344 to have final data from their respective Phase Ib clinical studies. We believe these studies will provide meaningful support for their potential in combination with KEYTRUDA, Venclexta and Avastin and present the opportunity to create with existing capital and resources, a compelling developmental to oncology story in just the next couple of years. 
Now the summary of the proposed transaction. The stockholder votes for both companies are scheduled for July 14, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. This is an all-stock transaction where Infinity stockholders will receive shares of the MEI common stock. Upon approval of the transaction, Infinity become a wholly owned subsidiary of MEI Pharma, with the outstanding equity ownership post closing of about 58% being held by MEI stockholders, and about 42% being held by Infinity stockholders. I'd now like to turn the call over to Rob, followed by Ezra to provide an overview of Eganelisib including the mechanism of action, clinical development to date, plans to start a Phase II study in patients with head and neck cancer and the need for new therapies to treat this type of cancer. 
After remarks from Rob and Ezra, Nick will join in for some discussion about Eganelisib and the plans for the continued clinical development.

Thanks, David, and welcome, everyone. Again, Eganelisib is a first-in-class potent and highly specific PI3 kinase gamma inhibitor. It's a small molecule. It's taken as a capsule daily and it has at least twofold, 2 log fold selectivity over the other isoforms. Infinity's interest in this target was because it was shown to be a very important switch that controls immune suppression and also may play a role in checkpoint inhibitor resistance. The reason Infinity has been interested in this target, there's a lot of data showing that if you block the signaling pathway, you tend to bias the tumor microenvironment towards a more activated or M1-like macrophage environment compared to the normal suppressive macrophage environment, which is M2 like. 
It's important to understand that PI3-kinase-gamma is quite distinct from the other PI3-kinase isoforms you may have heard of. For example, PVI 3 kinase alpha and beta are expressed ubiquitously in the body and playing very, very important roles in metabolism. PI3 kinase delta is more limitedly expressed in B and T cells. And if you block that pathway, you get -- tend to get a lot of autoimmunity. PI3 kinase gamma on the other hand, is much more restricted. It's only expressed in myeloid cells, and the adverse event profile was also distinct from the delta in that mainly blocking this pathway is associated with reversible hepatotoxicity, rash and occasionally fever or pyrexia. 
Infinity has had a broad development program for Eganelisib that includes 2 Phase II studies: one, MARIO-275 in platinum-resistant urothelial cancer and another MARIO-3 with metastatic TNBC. Both of these Phase II studies have had very encouraging data, which we presented previously. We've also provided Eganelisib in a collaboration with (inaudible) and we saw some very interesting data in TNBC and ovarian cancer, both of which were in a chemotherapy-free regimen. And our focus today is based on the Mario-1 where we had clinical experience and encouraging data in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, in particular, patients that were resistant to checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
I'll next hand it off to Dr. Ezra Cohen, who is an expert in head and neck cancer to lead us through the patient experience and treatment landscape. Ezra?

Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Robert, and thanks for allowing me to participate in this webcast. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is a locally-advanced disease, and it's important to note that for a couple of reasons. First of all, most patients are going to be treated with curative intent because they present with either local or locally advanced disease that is to say, a tumor with or without lymph nodes. 
In fact, it's unusual for patients to present with metastatic disease. However, despite the fact that we treat with curative intent, many patients, actually about 50% will unfortunately develop recurrent or metastatic disease. And that's where currently immunotherapy is being utilized. Now this is a global health issue, in that, there are about 60,000 cases in the United States per year. And incidentally, that number is climbing but about 10 to 20x that worldwide with almost 0.5 million deaths estimated to occur from head and neck cancer this year. You can see that the graphic on the left illustrates the point I was trying to make with an increase in the annual incidents. And this is primarily driven by HPV positive oropharynx cancer that we now recognized as an etiologic factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 
Now for patients with recurrent to metastatic disease, the current landscape really encompasses immunotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy and some targeted agents. Here you see a summary of some of -- at least some of the approaches that one can take in first-line anti-PD-1 monotherapy is often used. These are for patients whose tumors express PD-L1 or have a lesser tumor burden. Anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can also be used when PD-L1 status is either unknown or 0 in the tumor or for patients who have a greater tumor burden. And occasionally, patients in the first line will be treated with chemotherapy with or without an EGFR inhibitor, that EGFR inhibitor incidentally is often almost exclusively cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody. In the second line, it really becomes an undefined arena that is dependent on what patients we served in their first line and how preserve their performance status is. 
For anti-PD-1 naive patients, anti-PD-1 is often chosen for chemotherapy naive patients, a chemotherapy regimen will be used. And for anti-EGFR inhibitor naive patients Cetuximab will often be administered. And the third line, really here, the standard is completely undefined and very much dependent on what patients have received in the first and second line. Of course, molecular testing and the clinical trials are heavy considerations as they may influence the therapeutic choices. I talked about NTPD1 in the first line, and really that is based on the KEYNOTE-48 data using Pembrolizumab. Here, we see the results of Pembrolizumab monotherapy with respect to progression-free survival and overall survival in the KEYNOTE-048 study. This is the study that really set the standard of care in first-line recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and established pembrolizumab, the anti-PD-1 antibody in the use in these patients. 
What you see here is that in the 1 to 19 CPS expressing group, an initial decrement in the progression-free survival and then eventually equilration in the curves. And then in overall survival with the CPS 1-19 group, essentially parallel curves when compared to the triple regimen of platinum 5-FU and cetuximab. There's a little bit of a different story when one looks at a higher CPS expression level in the tumor that is CPS greater than or equal to 20. Again, you see that initial decrement in PFS, but then the overall survival clearly is improved in the CPS greater than or equal to 20 population with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to the extreme regimen. 
With that in mind, we can see where Mario-8 will fit into the landscape of recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer. Essentially, in the first line, one can combine Eganelisib with pembrolizumab yielding a potential IO/IO chemotherapy-free regimen in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 at CPS 1-19 but also in patients whose tumors express higher levels of PD-L1, that is the CPS greater than or equal to 20. Here you see the study design for Mario-8, it is a randomized Phase II in recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Patients will be treated in the first line. Their tumors will have to express some level of PD-L1. You can see the key stratification factors include PD-L1 expression by CPS, that is 1-19 versus greater than or equal to 20. The primary endpoint is overall survival with key secondary endpoints being progression-free survival and safety.
The other stratification factor is HPV status, which we now recognized as a strong prognostic factor in squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck. You see that Part A will be a dose finding section with a randomization of 2 to 1 two different -- to 2 different dosing regimens. Then upon optimization of the dose, that will be based on available efficacy and safety data from approximately 40 to 70 patients in Part A. Part B will then be initiated that will randomize patients 2:1 to Eganelisib and pembrolizumab versus placebo, pembrolizumab and the final overall survival analysis will then be undertaken. 
With that in mind, let me turn it over to Rob once again to discuss the basis for the MARIO-8 study the Phase I clinical site.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Ezra. MARIO-1 was our first-in-human study of Eganelisib alone or in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The first portion was a monotherapy dose escalation where we explored various doses of Eganelisib and the second was a dose escalation of Eganelisib in combination with nivolumab in a variety of different solid tumor types, which included patients that were refractory to immediate prior checkpoint inhibitor treatment, including patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. 
On this slide, you can see the various doses that we explored in monotherapy ranging from 10 to 60 milligrams a day. As you can see, doses from 10 to 40 milligrams daily were very near or above the EC90 of PI3 kinase gamma. Keep in mind, we want a very specific molecule. By the same token, all doses except the 60 milligrams, which was not taken forward were below the EC50 of PI3 kinase. 
Here is some biomarker data in which we're looking at the impact of Eganelisib monotherapy on immune activation in the peripheral blood. On the far left, you see as we go from day 0 to day 28, we see a very nice increase in gamma interferon responsive cytokines. In particular, we're showing here CXCL10. These are very important proteins that have been implicated as activated whenever you block the PI3 kinase gamma pathway. Importantly, associated with this upregulation of interferon gamma responsive cytokines, we see evidence of T-cell reinvigoration in the peripheral blood as well. And in addition, on the right, we see an increase in interferon-gamma responsive genes. All of these support that the Eganelisib mechanism of action is established as a monotherapy in the peripheral blood. 
When we look to safety, we see that the Eganelisib monotherapy was very well tolerated with no grade 3 treatment-related adverse events up through a dose of 40 milligrams a day. As you can see, as we dose escalated further to 60 milligrams a day, we started seeing evidence of liver enzyme increase, in particular, AST and ALT, in addition to some rash. For these reasons, we didn't bring the 60-milligram dose forward, but instead studied 30 and 40 milligrams. 
Here is showing you the safety profile of Eganelisib when combined with nivolumab. Again, we don't see any Grade 3 hepatic treatment-related adverse events up through 8 gram Eganelisib doses. We do see some rash in combination with nivolumab, which we had also seen as a monotherapy. Interestingly, the Grade 3 hepatic events that we did observe we're very quick to resolve. 
Generally, hepatic adverse events like autoimmune hepatitis with nivolumab may occur 2 to 4 months into treatment. In this case, we saw it very early. And instead of taking weeks to resolve, interestingly, this hepatotoxic that we observed was quick to resolve with a median duration of only about 9 days. The overall Grade 3 treatment-related hepatic event rate was about 18%. With this information, we moved forward to the randomized Phase II study MARIO-275. This Phase II study was in patients who were resistant to platinum combination chemotherapy, which is the standard of care in patients with advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. Patients were randomized to Eganelisib 40 milligrams daily in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab alone.
Here, I show you biomarker data now comparing Eganelisib and nivolumab compared to novolumab alone in the peripheral blood. As you can see on the left, we see a nice increase of interferon-gamma responsive cytokines like we had seen in monotherapy. But interestingly, it's even greater than you see with nivolumab alone, which is shown in light green. Similarly, on the far right, we're looking at T-cell reinvigoration like we had done with Eganelisib monotherapy. And you can see in the dark blue, we see enhanced T-cell reinvigoration in their peripheral blood compared to nivolumab alone, which is in that light green on the far right. 
Looking at safety, these are the treatment-related adverse events that were associated with treatment discontinuation of Eganelisib placebo and/or nivolumab. At the top, we showed that hepatic TAEs were indeed more common as a reason for treatment discontinuation with the combination of Eganelisib and enovlumab than nivolumab alone. But still, the overall treatment discontinuation rate was rather low at approximately 21%. 
If we look at patients discontinuing due to other reasons, in other words, non-hepatic TAEs, you actually see it's fairly similar between Eganelisib and nivolumab, and nivolumab and placebo. Regarding the hepatic TAEs, there was no evidence of (inaudible), which is a way of looking at severe hepatotoxicity. There were no grade 5 treatment-related adverse events and all the hepatic grades with TAEs resolved, except in 2 patients who came off of treatment for other reasons. However, because we did notice this imbalance of treatment discontinuation due to hepatic events, we decided to reduce the dose of Eeganelisib in this study from 40 milligrams to 30 milligrams. And we also added earlier monitoring of LFTs since as I mentioned earlier, we tend to see this hepatotoxicity if we're going to see it fairly early in treatment. 
Here is some efficacy that we had observed. In particular, the 2-year overall survival data in this study. This is for the entire population, in other words, the ITT. As you can see at the 2-year landmark survival analysis, 45% of patients on the Eganelisib plus nivolumab arm were alive compared to only 24% patients on the nivolumab control arm. Interestingly, we also saw the same profile even in PD-L1 negative patients. It turns out that in urothelial cancer, most patients have PD-L1 negative tumors. And you can see that we still saw an excellent 2-year OS landmark even in this population 
Next, I would like to hand this back over to Ezra Cohen again, who will review, in particular, the squamous cell head and neck clinical data from the MARIO-1 study.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Robert. Really, you set the stage quite nicely for the design of the Mario-8 and the rationale behind it. Based on MARIO-1 and of course, the urothelial study as well, here you see Eganelisib and nivolumab combination in patients having progressed on immediate prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. So just to put this into a context, the study concept really examine the activity of adding Eganelisib to an anti-PD-1 antibody in patients who were progressing on checkpoint inhibitors. So patients who had gotten first line and second line and now have had a checkpoint inhibitor and then were eligible to receive Eganelisib and in this case, nivolumab patients then were evaluated for response and by typical resist criteria. 
What we saw was that, in fact, in patients who had had 2 or fewer lines of therapy, a clear indicator of activity. Here you see patients A and B tracking the size of their tumor prior to initiation of the MARIO-1 study, and you can clearly see that there was a dramatic increase in tumor volume. Then the start from MARIO-1 that is the initiation of Eganelisib and nivolumab and a dramatic reduction in their tumor volume. In fact, patient A is 63% tumor reduction with a progression-free survival of 11 months and patient B a 36% tumor reduction with a progression-free survival of 7 months. Clearly, this would not have happened with a simple continuation of the anti-PD-1 antibody. 
With respect to the safety from MARIO-1, specifically in the head and neck cancer cohort, there were really no signals that were different than what Rob had described in his earlier discussion. You see the most common treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in greater than 15% of patients that were reflective of the larger population. Again, the hepatic adverse events appear in about 20% to 25% of patients. With respect to the Grade 3, the table on the right that occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of patients. Again, the hepatic events are at the top. But in general, really a well-tolerated combination with nivolumab the anti-PD-1 antibody.
Here you see the idea that in patients who had received 2 or fewer prior lines of therapy, we saw 2 partial responses yielding an objective response rate of 20%. So clearly, this was an indicator to us that there was activity. There was the opportunity to reverse resistance to anti-PD-1 antibodies. But our best signal was also in patients who were not heavily pretreated, which intuitively makes sense. And of course, part of the rationale for the MARIO-8 study that, again, you see here, patients now in the first line with recurrent or metastatic disease, whose tumors express some level of PD-L1 undertaking the combination of Eganelisib and the approved anti-PD-1 in first-line head and neck cancer that is pembrolizumab. 
And now with that in mind, let me turn it back to Rob to discuss the time lines associated with Mario-8.

Thank you, Ezra. Yes, the study team is working hard, and we have an estimated study start to occur in Q3 of this year. Using the adaptive design that Dr. Cohen described for Part A, we anticipate that we will have preliminary efficacy and safety data from approximately 40 to 70 patients sometime in the second half of 2024. And that decision, as we mentioned, we will move from Part A to Part B to continue the randomized Phase II study. 
In summary, we've shown you very encouraging data from heavily pretreated patients with advanced metastatic head and neck cancer patients. In particular, patients whose tumors had progressed on an immediate prior checkpoint inhibitor treatment. As you can see, the supported further investigation of Eganelisib in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. And this is also why the design that Dr. Cohen went over, MARIO-8 study, is in first-line recurrent metastatic squamous cell cancer in combination with the standard of care of pembrolizumab. We've received FDA feedback on the study design and we plan to move forward with the randomized Phase II study in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, and this study also includes dose optimization, as Dr. Cohen described. 
And again, the estimated study start will be in Q3 of 2023 within anticipated dosing decision in the second half of 2024, which will include preliminary safety and efficacy data on approximately 40 to 70 patients. And with that, I'll hand it off to Dr. Nick Abbott, we will start the Q&A section. Thank you.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Dr. Ilaria. So maybe starting with Dr. Cohen as an internationally recognized head and neck cancer specialist, you have your pick of experimental therapies. So just remind us again, what excites you about Eganelisib?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Nick. I think there's a few factors that we really need to keep in mind when we think about Eganelisib in this context, First of all, we've seen the preliminary data that formed the rationale for the MARIO-8 study, that ability to reverse resistance to checkpoint inhibition. 
But when we think about the first line, we're certainly encouraged that pembrolizumab has shown efficacy and long-term survival in about 20% of patients but that means that 80% of these patients are unfortunately still dying of their disease. So you can clearly see that there is room for improvement in this patient population. And so when we think about that, we begin to think about, well, what's the biology of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, especially with respect to the tumor macro environment and how can we influence that? And that's where Eganelisib really is the right drug to use in this disease. 
Our group and others have shown the importance of the immunosuppressive effect of macrophages and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, Eganelisib clearly reverses that effect to go from immunosuppressive to immunostimulatory recruiting T cells to the tumor. So the mechanism makes sense. In addition to that, what we've seen in all the data so far is that Eganelisib can be readily combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies to deliver a well-tolerated IO-IO combination. So safety is likely not going to be an issue in that combination. And then moreover, we have an opportunity to increase and successfully or perhaps specifically in that CPS 1-19 population where pembrolizumab was good, but not better than the older standard therapy. 
So Eganelisib can be readily added, hopefully, improve efficacy in all levels of CPS PD-L1 expression, 1-19 and greater than 20 offer a chemotherapy-free regimen with 2 immunotherapy acting agents. And certainly, we're quite encouraged about the prospects of Mario-8 when you think about it in that context.

Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. Dr. Illaria, I know you treat patients, but now putting your drug developer at on. Is there anything else you'd like to add? I mean, I think a lot of investors were a little surprised about the choice of head and neck cancer versus continuing in urothelial bladder or triple-negative breast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Ilaria,  Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Well, and I think now that we presented this data showing what clinical activity we had in the checkpoint inhibitor refractory space, I hope this provides additional enthusiasm for why we chose this. In addition, as Dr. Cohen alluded to, we had encouraging data in a mostly PD-L1 negative tumor type urothelial cancer. And we've also presented data in Mario 3 and TNBC in which we saw pretty similar signs of efficacy even in PD-L1 negative tumors in that as well. And so we're very optimistic. This is a very macrophage-rich tumor. 
And in addition, there -- we believe that patients -- there's still room for improvement, particularly in the low CPS score range. And we think our data in the other tumor type supports this. The other thing we like about head and neck cancer is that we think we'll be able to -- unfortunately for patients, the PFS and OS time lines are relatively short. The patients are -- have been benefited from PD-1-based treatments, but still we have a lot of room to go. And we believe that we'll be able to get answers about the potential benefit in this patient population earlier than perhaps some other tumor types.

Let's just sort of follow up on that. I think you said expect top line data second half of next year. Dr. Cohen, in your opinion, what is the hurdle for success in a frontline population?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think Robert made, first of all, some terrific points about the finer issue of PD-L1 expression and potential efficacy. But Nick, to answer your question, really, we're looking for improvements in long-term survival. Again, what we saw with pembrolizumab, either monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in the 5-year data from Keynote-048 is that about 20%, maybe a little bit more than that are alive at 5 years. 
Now that's fantastic because prior to anti-PD-1, that number was essentially 0. So we've made definitely some progress. But I think what we want to do now is further increase that. And especially where those patients in the -- whose tumors express CPS at 1-19, where there is still controversy on whether to use pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab chemotherapy or some practitioners don't even use anti-PD-1 in that setting because they're not completely convinced that immunotherapy works well for those patients. 
And it's so interesting to me that in urothelial cancer and Rob mentioned TNBC, that Eganelisib appear to be effective even in those tumors that don't express PD-L1 at high levels. And in fact, in some tumors that don't express PD-L1 at all. So here is a great opportunity to really bring immunotherapy to the forefront, addressing an important mechanism in squamous cell carcinoma of the head neck and that is macrophages or MDSCs with Eganelisib.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And so just to push you a little bit. As you noted from the 048 trial, there was a decrement of PFS pembro versus standard of care. So are you looking to see sort of a reversal of that? I know this is just pembro placebos, there is no active chemo control. But is that what you sort of need to see really to push forward is okay? We're having some benefit on PFS acknowledging that OS is the gold standard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think, Nick, that you put it quite well. We'd like to see that initial signal of an improvement in PFS over pembrolizumab alone. I think that will give us a lot of confidence. Ultimately, it is going to be overall survival, that's going to drive the most important decisions on development and of course, ultimately, patient care. 
We'd love to see, and in fact, are anticipating that we will see a PFS that is numerically comparable to what we see with pemelizumab chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. That would really, I think, strengthen the position for Eganelisib anti-PD-1 combination in all PD-L1 expressing tumors, irrespective of what that CPS is as long as it's greater than 1. We'll see what the data show, but that's exactly the hope. And in fact, for what we see in the preliminary data so far, it's quite conceivable that we'll see that encouraging early PFS signal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's hope patients and the drug -- in terms of moving forward from the Phase II, how do you think about registration and beyond? I mean use multiple modalities to treat this disease and maybe as an aside or an add-on to that, do you think there's a faster market opportunity in the CPS less than 20% population?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think so. I think that, again, based on the data that we've seen so far, that there really is an opportunity in that low-ish PD-L1 expression cohort that CPS 1-19, where pembrolizumab alone is approved, but by no means widely accepted. There are a lot of patients who are still receiving chemotherapy in that low-ish PD-L1 expressing -- tumor expressing cohort. 
So an IO-IO combination that works in that tumor type, I think, would be incredibly welcome for these patients. Moreover, in the grand scheme of things, Eganelisib so far, be it in combination with anti-PD-1 or with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been very well tolerated. So there's every reason to believe that as agents come into play and other agents get developed in head and neck cancer, Eganelisib would be able to combine very well with other mechanisms, other targets. 
And what we have here is an agent that can essentially modify the tumor microenvironment and augment whatever it's partner will be in terms of activity and efficacy. So one could see that it would be applicable to first-line recurrent metastatic and eventually, maybe even locally advanced disease where the great majority of patients present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrific. You mentioned partners and obviously, MEI and Infinity are not the only company who are interested in head and neck cancer. So do you see the standard of care changing substantially over the next few years? And what potential partners would you think might end up being combined with Eganelisib.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly. We're seeing some encouraging data from other clinical trials. For instance, we know that a Phase III study combining lenvatinib with pembrolizumab has completed accrual. We have yet to see the data, we anticipate those data will likely emerge in probably 8 to 12 months. And that may set a new standard of care for patients whose tumors express PD-L1. 
But again, I'll emphasize the ability to combine Eganelisib with really almost anything else, including a potential pembrolizumab/lenvatinib combination and even further augment the efficacy of that combination. Moreover, there are a newer generation of EGFR antibodies that are being developed, building on some of the success that we've had with cetuximab. So these are primarily by specifics that have EGFR as one of the arms in the bispecific antibody. But again, these are agents that one could readily combine with Eganelisib if they become part of the standard of care. 
And moreover, when we think about locally advanced disease and the potential for some newer agents to enter the spectrum there, such as the SMAC Mimetic Xevinapant which just completed accrual of a Phase III study in locally advanced disease. And again, the potential to add Eganelisib to that combination exists and could be readily explored.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Ilaria coming back to you. So you mentioned some encouraging data in urothelial bladder. We have some data in triple net. So how do you think about potential utility of Eganelisib beyond head and neck cancer?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Ilaria,  Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think Dr. Cohen mentioned this as well that the tumor microenvironment is very macrophage-rich in a lot of solid tumors. So we believe that if we have compelling data in head and neck cancer in a robust randomized Phase II setting, there's very good reason to believe this combination similar to that could work in other solid tumors because we don't have a lot of evidence. The solid tumors are that different as far as being macrophage rich. 
So you think robust data in a tumor type like squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, really provides potential opportunities for other indications and other tumor types such as lung cancer or other tumors particularly ones that tend to have lower PD-L1 expression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And maybe just following up on that. We saw in the urothelial bladder data, the ability of Eganelisib potentially to neutralize that negative PD-L1 poor prognosic indicator. Dr. Cohen -- and putting a broader had on, how problematic are these low PD-1 patients? How common are they in solid tumors? And what do you do with those patients?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly, it depends on the tumor type. And we know that some solid tumors express -- tend to express high levels of PD-L1 in the tumor. Head and neck cancer is one of those. But others tend to express very low levels or 0 PD-L1. And now that the checkpoint inhibitors have become such an important part of cancer therapy showing that for some patients with metastatic disease treated with anti-PD-1 antibody or PD-L1 antibody alone, we can have long-term survival measured in years. 
And for some of these patients, we're even thinking they may be cured of metastatic disease, something that was unmanageable even a short time ago. So with -- with anti-PD-1s being so important, the ability to augment their efficacy with an IO-IO combination, especially in patients who are less responsive and less likely to benefit, that is the tumors that don't express PD-L1 or express at low levels, I think, would be an incredible advantage for not only head and neck cancer, but across all of oncology. Here is really a strategy that could be applied to multiple tumor types, and the potential is really profound.

Great. Thank you very much. And with that, I'll wrap it up, and we look forward to data from Mario-8 in the second half of next year. Thanks, gentlemen.

Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Walsey,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - SVP of Corporate Affairs    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Ezra, Rob and Nick. I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Richard to provide an overview of the voruciclib and ME-344 programs, after which he will be joined by Nick for some additional discussion on each program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, David. I'm delighted to be able to introduce MEI pipeline, both voruciclib and ME-344, beginning with voruciclib, our oral CDK9 inhibitor. For each of the 2 products, I'll follow the same logic, beginning by the scientific rationale, why we're exciting about the asset, the clinical data from past and present studies as well as where we see the development going forward. 
So for voruciclib, we are very excited about this asset because it targets an important target that impact cell proliferation called the CDK9. So voruciclib is a CDK9 inhibitor. And the relevance of that target is it can decrease the production of 2 proteins, MCL1 and MIC. MCL1 is a protein that is important for cell survival. The drivers of it clinically is that it is a poor prognostic factor in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or CLL. In addition to that, MCL1 overexpression is a known mechanism of resistance to venetoclax, which is a member of the BCL2 family of protein that actually lead to stabilization of MCL1.
Voruciclib by inhibiting MCL1 via CDK9 inhibitor could make venetoclax more active and prevent resistance to this product. A completely separate mechanism is inhibition of MIC. The MIC gene is an important oncogene that is expressed at higher value in many cancers, including tumors that also express KRAS mutation. Voruciclib by inhibiting CDK9 can also inhibit MIC, and we will talk about it a little bit later. 
As I mentioned, Voruciclib is CDK9. So what are the CDK or cyclin-dependent kinase, those are a set of enzymes that are essential for cell cycle regulations. There are a variety of CDKs and CDK9 is the one relevant to that discussion. Voruciclib has a specificity for CDK9 compared to other CDK. And as important, it does not impact other kinase at the dose and concentration we are using in the clinic as can be seen on the KINOMEscan to the right. Our focus -- our early development focus is now on the effect of voruciclib on MCL1. And the hypothesis is the one we touched on it a moment ago, that increased MCL1 is an established mechanism of resistance to venetoclax. 
And in addition, it is also associated with poor outcome in AML and CLL. We know and there have been several complications in effect that venetoclax inhibit BCL-2, but that, in its turn, increased stabilization of MCL1. Therefore, combining voruciclib to venetoclax may counteract the effect on MCL1, decrease MCL production and, therefore, return resensibility to venetoclax activity. 
So I had a couple of slides to show you nonclinical data supporting that hypothesis, beginning an AML xenograft model in Myc where we have 3 panels here to the top shows decrease MCL-1 production with voruciclib. it doesn't decrease with MCL1 with Venetoclax rather. However, the combination also shows a decrease MCL1 production. 
The impact on that is the combination increased apoptosis, meaning cell death. These are the bars to the right in Panel B, and that leads to improved survival, the panel C to the right where you see in green, the survival curve with the animal treated with the combination significantly superior to the one showing a single-agent therapy with Venetoclax or voruciclib.
And now that I presented the AML Murine xenograft Model and the work and to present to you another preclinical model, this one in an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma called the huge large cell lymphoma. Here we have data on 6 different DLBCL cell line. And while I'd like to shown this experiment is one, a decrease in MCL1 that was dose dependent as can be seen on the panel A, to the left against 6 cell line. And then the panel to the right is an assessment of a decrease in tumor growth in the 6 cell line, single agent voruciclib, single agent Venetoclax and the combination read. And as you can see, in all cases, the combination was synergistic, more effective than either agent alone, both in decreasing tumor growth and bottom right slide is effect on animal survival. 
Now let's turn our attention to the clinical development program. With the earlier studies conducted by a prior sponsor, Piramal, in which they conducted 2 Phase I studies in patients with advanced solid tumors. And they investigated 2 different dosing schedule, one where voruciclib is given daily continuously. And the other one where it's given for 14 days on and 7 days off. As you may know, other CDK inhibitors are given on an intermittent schedule such as 21 days on or in a 28-day cycle. 
The take-home messages of these 2 Phase I trials is that the maximum tolerated dose was 600-milligram when voruciclib was given on 17 -- rather 2 weeks on, 1 week off, and 350 milligrams when given daily continuously. Those are important numbers because we at MEI believe that voruciclib dose in combination with Venetoclax in the range of 100 to 200-milligram will be sufficient to inhibit the target and result in clinical benefit, way below the MTD defined in the dose escalation studies and solid tumors. 
Important findings from these studies also is there were no evidence of neutropenia in these patients with solid tumor. There were no preliminary toxicity and no effect on the heart. As far as efficacy, as expected in those studies in very advanced stage disease, we have had some patients who have achieved disease stabilization and 1 or 2 patients who achieved a partial response and some of these disease stabilization lasted for up to 4 months. 
I want to point to that set of experiments that was conducted in 1 of the 2 Phase I studies. And that relates to the mid inhibition that I had mentioned earlier. Blood samples were obtained from patients in this study at baseline before starting voruciclibs and at every cycle for several cycles of therapy. Those are examples from blood sample from 2 patients in which 10 genes were evaluated and the one of interest to us today is the MIC circled in green in these 2 patient panels. As you can see, at baseline, MIC was overexpressed that with therapy MIC levels decrease from baseline. Again, indicating from these earlier trials that we do see in effect on MIC with voruciclib treatment. 
Now let's prove it to MEI conducted studies. When we acquired the asset, we saw that there is value in moving the development of voruciclib first in patients with hematologic malignancies, taking an advantage of the effect on voruciclib on this MCL1. And that was driven by 2 factors. One, the realization voruciclib is primarily a CDK9 inhibitor and two, the fact that we had data from patients sample with CLL as well as preclinical study shows the synergy with a combination with venetoclax. And our initial focus has been on enrolling patients with acute myeloleukemia and B-cell malignancies, including CLL.
So this summarizes the Phase I study. It had 2 phases or 2 stages. The first stage with a monotherapy dose escalation meeting escalating voruciclib as a single agent from a low dose up to a dose of 200-milligram as shown in the middle. This was conducted in patients with both AML and B-cell malignancies and enrollment and the readout of that phase of the study is completed with 40 patients enrolled. We are currently enrolling in the second stage of the study evaluating for voruciclib in combination with Venetoclax in patients with AML, beginning at a low dose of 50 milligrams every other day and intend to go all the way to approximately 200 milligrams. 
We have presented at ASH 2021 the initial readout of the dose-escalation monotherapy. Key highlights are shown here for safety. There were 2 groups. As you can see, group 1 is when we dosed voruciclib daily continuously, then we pedibited to administer voruciclib on an intermittent schedule of 14 days on, 40 days off. And that is the schedule that we took in further development and then the one we are evaluating in combination with venetoclax. As you can see on the table on the intermittent schedule, which is called the group 2, there were no grade 3 or higher adverse events related to the product. In fact, the (inaudible) is generally good. There were no significant myelosuppression in patients with B-cell malignancies and no grade 3/4 neutropenia in patients with B-cell malignancies. We have not seen tumor lysis syndrome, and there were no fatal toxicity due to the drugs. 
Now let me go into more detail both on safety and efficacy. During the dose escalation, we initially evaluated voruciclib on a daily continuously dosing schedule. At the 100-milligram dose level, 2 patients develop pulmonary toxicity. It is unclear if this was due to the drug or to the fact that these patients had undergone prior stem cell transplant, had graft versus host disease and during therapy, may have developed a differentiation syndrome that can be seen in AML patient receiving active treatment. Therefore, in collaboration with our investigator, we decided to evaluate another dosing schedule administering voruciclib on a 14 days on, 14 days off schedule. 
And with this schedule, we went to those from 100 to 150 to 200-milligram without observing dose-limiting toxicities. We stopped dose escalation at 200 milligrams because we believe these doses are sufficient to inhibit the target, and there were no need to continue dose escalation just for the purpose of defining the MTD in hematologic malignancies. We have seen in these patients who are heavily pretreated. In fact, the median prior therapy was 3 and up to 8 in 1 patient. Some clinical activity, including 1 patient with follicular lymphoma who had a near partial response lasting 6 months in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma that has disease stabilization lasting for 4 months, and 1 patient with AML, who achieved what is called a morphology leukemia-free state. 
Overall, at the 200-milligram dose level in patients receiving the 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off schedule, about half of the 24 patients has seen some disease stabilization or a response. Now, we can move to the ongoing stage of this study, which is the combination of voruciclib with venetoclax. We are starting at a very low dose at the request of FDA because we have introduced a new formulation in this combination that has several advantage. So far, we have completed enrollment at this first dose level. And we have not seen any additive toxicity from the combination. In fact, we have seen 2 interesting efficacy observation in patients with AML who have been very heavily pretreated, One of these patients achieved a partial response and that patient had received prior stem cell transplant, prior to venatoclax and prior to combination chemotherapy. 
Another patient who are relying heavily on transfusion priority study were voruciclib and venetoclax, went for several weeks without any transfusions. So overall, we are very encouraged by this very, very primary data and look forward to continuing enrollment and accumulating data with the combinations. 
Now let's look toward the future. and where the clinical development of voruciclib can be. First, initially, it will be in patient with acute myeloid leukemia, AML is primarily a disease of elderly patients or patients who are unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy. In this population, venetoclax in combination with a hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine or with low-dose cytarabine is the standard of care. Based on multiple Phase III studies. While this has been an improvement in response rate and survival compared to a single agent hypomethylating agent. The median survival remains short at about 15 months.
Therefore, there is a need to improve response rates and survival in these patients. Voruciclib in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax could lead to improved in response rate and ultimately survival and represent a path for development of this compound. In addition, what should not discount the possibility to see benefit in patients with relapsed AML after having failed standard treatment, in which the median overall survival today with current therapy is very short, typically less than 6 months. Therefore, adding voruciclib to venetoclax in this setting could also potentially be an improvement in patient care. 
Another approach is in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where Venetoclax in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody, like rituximab, is currently approved as a frontline treatment or in the relapsed setting. There is a possibility that voruciclib can enhance the activity of venetoclax with CD20 in patient CML and could be developed either in the relapse setting as a treatment or substituting the anti-CD20 with voruciclib, leading to a completely ordered regimen in patients with CLL. 
With that now, I will go to summarize overall, what we know on voruciclib. It's an oral CDK9 inhibitor. The prefilled data we have today, demonstrating down regulation of MCL1 and synergy with Venetoclax in multiple hematologic malignancies model. We know that increased MCL1 is an important target to effect to improve on Venetoclax activity since it is the main mechanism of resistant to venetoclax. Early clinical data shows encouraging results, both in terms of tolerability, where we do not anticipate overall toxicity -- overlapping toxicity between venetoclax and voruciclib. And we've already seen some clinical activity that is encouraging. The current Phase I study is enrolling in the combination of Venetoclax plus voruciclib and we anticipate seeing the preliminary results of the dose escalation stage toward the end of the year. And with this proof of principle of the combination of being established, one can evaluate the combination with Venetoclax in other disease where Venetoclax is the standard of care. 
Now I will turn to the other MEI compound ME-344. I am very excited about this asset because it has a very unique method of actions. In fact, that is also an exciting our investigators who are currently participating in our ongoing study in colorectal cancer. So let me step back a moment and explain to you the mechanism of action of ME-344. And with that, we have to talk about cell energy, why and how does this cell, normal cell, or malignant cell obtain their energy. 
Primarily cells obtain their energy through the mitochondria, a small molecule called ATP. ME-344 inhibit the production of ATP by blocking a pathway called the Oxphos pathway.  However, as we know, as I mentioned it, cells also have other ways to get their energy. And one of it is through use of glucose or sugar, that's called a glycolytic energy. In cancer cells, there is a big reliance on the glycolytic energy. There is a class of drug antiangiogenic drugs, like Avastin that lock the production of this pathway of the glycolytic pathway, making cells switched to rely more on the mitochondrial energy. And here, you can imagine that by adding ME-344 in combination with Avastin. Now you're blocking completely the pathways that cell depend on it to get their energy and that can lead to cell dust. So we can see synthetic litality by combining these 2 class of agents. And that is what excites me about this compound. 
So let's give you a background about ME-344 preclinical data. This is the effect on 200 different cell lines, the panel to the left. And the waterfall plot shows a decrease in inhibition of cell proliferation or ME-344 alone. And you can see in the very large majority of the cell tested, there is a significant decrease in proliferation. And I think one example of that, which is the panel to the right, (inaudible) and cell line from ovarian cancer where you can see a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation with ME-344, these are the lines to the bottom compared to the control arm, which is the top line going upward. This is single-agent activity. More relevant to the discussion about the combination of ME-344 and Avastin is this animal model. This is a colorectal cancer model, where ME-344 was combined within all endogenic kinase inhibitor called regorafenib. 
And this is 2 panels: one to show to the left, an improvement survival when ME-344 was combined with rigorafenib. And to the right, this was due to a decrease in tumor growth. Again, in red is a combination of the 2 drugs. 
Now let's turn to update you on the clinical data with ME-344, beginning with the earlier trial conducted by MEI. First, a single agent Phase I dose escalation study that's been published and next was a Phase I/II study in combination with a chemotherapy called Topotecan. So let me give a quick snapshot information on these 2 studies. The first one was a standard dose escalation study. By the 3+3 design that enrolled 30 patients from the lowest dose of 1.5 milligrams per kilogram all the way to 20. 
The important information learned from that trial is those up to 10-milligram per kilogram were well tolerated, and that was the dose that was selected for further development. And the dose-limiting toxicities at higher dose than 10-milligram was neuropathy. It is no surprise that one can see neuropathy with mitochondria inhibitor. After all nerves, the nervous system require a lot of energy to communicate the signal. So blocking the energy by decreasing the ATP production could lead to neuropathy. But again, we only see it at the higher dose of 15 and 20 milligram, which we do not intend to use in our current studies. 
In these very heavily pretreated patients, one of the patients achieved a partial response, a patient with small cell lung cancer, another patient achieved stable disease with a disease control rate a little bit over 1/3 of the patients. It is that patient with lung cancer who had achieved a partial response that led to the conduct of the next study, combining the chemothepy topotecan that is approved for lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, with ME-344. 46 patients were enrolled and what we have noticed is there was significant myelosuppression with this combination. I believe, in part due to the fact that we have used a higher dose of topotecan that typically use in this disease. In addition to that, we have seen patients with ovarian cancer achieved a partial response and an overall disease stabilization rate of about half of the patients. 
While these studies -- so this is kind of a brief summary of the safety profile. This table is directly from the published paper as you can look in the grade 3 toxicity, the only one of relevance is the one that relates to neuropathy that I mentioned to you and was only at the higher dose and as well as fatigue and dizziness. As you can see, there were no other significant toxicities as a monotherapy. And this is briefly resummarizing the efficacy data with the disease control rate about 1/3 of the patient as a monotherapy. And to the right, the bars in blue are patients on the ME-344 regimen and how long they had stayed on treatment. And as you can see, their duration on therapy for many of these patients was much longer than it was on the prior regimen, indicating a biologic activity. 
Now let's pivot to the interesting combination of ME-344 and Avastin, the anti-VEGF inhibitor. The initial proof of concept for that was done in animal model conducted with a collaborator in Spain, who then, with our agreement, decide to take the next step, which is evaluated a combination in patients. Not so much to look at evidence of clinical efficacy but more as a proof of concept of biologic activity. That is called a window of opportunity study. It was conducted in 40 patients with breast cancer. Now the reason we selected breast cancer is when a breast cancer tend to -- have to wait several weeks to get their scheduled surgery appointment and get prepared for it. So during that time, there's a possibility to do a very brief experiment to evaluate drugs and see what is biologic effect, both before starting treatment and after starting treatment. So this is exactly what was conducted in that trial that has been since published. 
And I will give you the top line results. So in this study, these women who had a breast cancer that was a HER2 negative, again planned to undergo surgery, underwent initial biopsy, received 1 dose of Avastin on day 1, then 3 doses of ME-344 once a week for 3 weeks. And then they receive -- underwent another biopsy at the end of the treatment. Again, the purpose of that trial is to look at biologic effect and the readout was through the biopsy. Highlighted on this slide, that key readout that was used in this study is something called Ki-67. It's a well-established marker of cell proliferation and has been used in many studies as a way to determine whether a drug or a combination of drugs can be effective in breast cancer. So that is what was used in that study. 
And the panels in the middle and to the right, shows the treatment effect. In green is the combination and going downward shows a decrease in Ki-67, which is a desired outcome. As you can see, the combination in green has a significant improvement in decrease in Ki-67 compared to the control arm who received bevacizumab alone in gray. That's in all patients, the panel to the middle and a subset of patients who have normalization of vascularization, which is more prominent in fact, the treatment effect. 
So based on these data, we have decided to launch a clinical study now with a clinical readout, and we decided to run this study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Because this is a group of patients who have failed all stat of therapy and for which there is really no very active treatment today. 
In addition, the readout in these diseases tend to be relatively short. So the current study is designed as a standard Phase I/II study, where we enroll patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of standard therapy. Patients are administered ME-344 and bevacizumab like it was done in the prior study, but now a cycle repeated until disease progression or toxicity. The goal is to enroll first 20 patients, assess safety and efficacy and then enroll another set of 20 patients in its second stage. The study now is open to enrollment. And hopefully, we will have data to present on this time -- on this study sometime in the near future. 
So overall, where does this take us? Clearly, there remains an unmet need in patients with colorectal cancer. Currently approved drug in the third or later line of therapy are the oral kinase inhibitor and a chemotherapy. However, with these agents, the response rate is less than 5%, and the median progression-free survival remained very short. So any improvement in both the response rate and PFS with a combination with ME-344 and bevacizumab will be a significant advantage to patients in this setting. 
Next, we can envision other scenario where Avastin is approved as a single agent or in combination, where addition of ME-344 could enhance the efficacy of bevacizumab alone or Avastin alone and/or the combination with other agents. And there are a number of diseases where Avastin is currently approved where this approach can be conceived. Now that I present to you our thoughts about future potential develop ME-344, I would like to kind of bring all together conclusion remark. 
ME-344 is very exciting because it's unique mix of action, inhibit mitochondria. We have clinical data showing synergy with antiangiogenic inhibitor, whether Avastin or oral TKI in several preclinical models. We have a study that was conducted as a window of open study in patients with breast cancer, in which we have demonstrated an effect on Ki-67, a biomarker of cell proliferation in which the combination and a placebo-controlled study showed a significant decrease in Ki-67 compared to what was observed with Avastin alone. And with this, we have now launched a Phase I/II study or Phase Ib study in patients with relapsed metastatic colorectal cancer. Phase I -- Stage 1 rather, of cohort 1 will have it's initial readout towards the end of the year, that will then take us to evaluate the combination in Stage 2 next year. 
And with that now at the conclusion of the prepared remarks, I would like to invite Nick Abbott to join me here to have a discussion on the program. Nick has over 35 years of experience in the biotech space. First as a bench scientist at companies both in the U.K. and in the U.S. And then after that, he had spent a lot of time at Wall Street, most recently as a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, where Nick covered over 20 biotech company, primarily in the oncology space. So Nick, I'm delighted to see you, and welcome.

Questions and Answers

Dr. Ghalie, appreciate the overview of those 2 exciting clinical programs. Moving back to voruciclib first, maybe from a clinical investigator perspective, what differentiates voruciclib from other CDK9 inhibitors that are in development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Nick, that's a very good question. And I'm really excited about voruciclib for a variety of reasons. Some are related to the pharmaceutics of the compound. It is oral. So clearly, an advantage when a drug needs to be given frequently to patients or at least enable that versatility if needed. It also has a long half-life. So it's over 24 hours, which allows us to give it only once a day, again, advantages for patients. It also has a high volume of distributions, which I know we didn't discuss in the formal presentation, that means it can go to tissue. So in disease where it's primarily a tissue disease, that certainly would be an advantage. 
There's also several attributes from the biology of the compound that makes it very attractive. And primarily, the fact that it is and the dose used in the patient in our study. It is highly specific to CDK9, avoiding the off-target toxicity that could have been seen in the earlier generation CDK9 and that certainly makes it an advantage for use as a single agent, but primarily also when used in combination. So a lot of attributes that makes it, in my view, a differentiated and, hopefully, a better CDK9.

Maybe from a slightly different perspective, but sort of getting at the same question, given competition for patients in early stage clinical trials, can you characterize how enthusiastic investigators have been in awe to enroll patients onto the trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. It's actually been very rewarding to see that interest from our investigators to be part of the trial. In fact, we really have a top-tier investigators from top-tier academic institutions that are participating in this study. And so when we approach them to see if they will be interested in the trial, the first answer is yes. 
We would like to be part of it because we like the target. CDK9 is very important today in the hematology space. So they wanted to sign up and a study looking at a new CDK9 inhibitor. And then we did the Phase I monotherapy dose escalation. They liked what they have seen primarily the fact that it can be given orally once a day and also perhaps more importantly, the safety profile of the compound. So when we decided to open the combination of Venetoclax, they certainly were very excited to be part of that phase of the study. And I think what makes them even more interested now than even just a class is the fact that we haven't seen myelosuppression with voruciclib to date, which certainly this is an advantage when think about combination of venetoclax and maybe at a later time with other agents. 
So I think there's a lot of interest and support from our investigators to be part of that trial and lead it to actually where we can see and publish the data.

You described elegantly the rationale of combining voruciclib with venetoclax in AML, venetoclax approved indication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well. So how do you and your KOLs think about expansion into B-cell malignancies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you mentioned in the presentation, currently, our focus is on AML in combination with Venetoclax and eventually perhaps moving to front line in combination with Venetoclax and azacitidine. Nevertheless, as you mentioned, Venetoclax is a key drug for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Venetoclax in combination with anti-CD20 antibody is approved in frontline treatment in all the patients and all patients in the relapsed setting. 
And so we would like to enhance the activity of venetoclax plus anti-CD20 primarily in relapse setting. We know that CLI is a ratably evolving landscape with a BTKI Venetoclax now. And therefore, we think the better position at present would be in the relapsed setting, either in combination with venetoclax and rituximab or perhaps and that will be data driven using only an oral combination regimen, venetoclax and voruciclib without the rituximab. That's something, of course, we would need to investigate before we go into -- later kind of decision about that combination.

Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. In your prepared comments, you mentioned that Piramil started evaluating Voruciclib in solid tumors. Obviously, those studies were done prior to us really having a good handle on KRAS on MIC-amplify tumors. So what are your thoughts about moving voruciclib into solid tumors perhaps in a more selected setting than has been looked at previously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. I'm very excited about that possibility and for a variety of reasons. One, because it opens multiple opportunities in different solid tumors that either express MIC or the KRAS mutations. In fact, Piramal had provided some of the data that actually supported the idea of going into a MIC or KRAS mutated. 
And if you may recall, when I did the formal presentation, I present data from patient sample from one of the earlier Phase I studies in solid tumor that showed in patients who were tested a reduction in Myc in about 2/3 of the patients. So we already have that evidence in patients. And we have conducted and already presented at AACR in 2022.  Data on the combination with KRAS inhibitor and voruciclib that shows activity and cell line. And our focus now is to build the nonclinical package, incentive experiments that kind of guide us in the next step to decide where and when we will move into the clinic in solid tumor. 
But clearly, the potential opportunity would be in KRAS mutated tumors, and it doesn't have to be only the current drugs, but also potential new drugs that are being developed to target different mutation in the KRAS pathway.

Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks. So let's move to ME-344, a novel mechanism of action. How is this resonating with clinicians use peak wave and particularly in the context, we've had a lot of failures in targeting metabolic pathways in cancer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. I checked the process of determining how and which disease to evaluate ME-344 with bevacizumab originated an advisory board meeting we had not too long ago. And the first reaction from the adviser we had at the meeting and this Advisory Board had a presentation from different therapeutic and cancer expertise. 
And the common theme that we heard at the meeting is we like what you present to us ME-344 because it has a different mechanism of actions. They particularly understand the science behind the combination of a VEGF inhibitor and ME-344, where really we're blocking completely in at least rately proliferating tumor cells, the source of energy. So they like, the new mechanism of action. They like the science. They like the fact that we have data from the window for pretty studies in patients, showing that the biology is translating to a positive readout in a biomarker, the AiCC 7, and they're really exciting now to test it in patients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And you've mentioned, obviously, the wind of opportunity study was done in breast cancer, remind us again why switch to colorectal cancer? When can investors expect top line data in what, in your view, is the hurdle for efficacy for moving to Stage 2?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All good question. And perhaps we can begin with answering first. Like why was the window of studies performed in breast cancer? Why pick that specific disease. And the reason is rather to be simple, patients with breast cancer needs some time to have their surgery schedules. And typically, at least in Spain, where the study was conducted, it's usually about a month. So it was really a perfect opportunity to slot a study like the one that was indeed conducted to look at bevacizumab and ME-344 that give the time to do the initial biopsy, administer drug and look at the readout 4 weeks later. 
The intent was really to study whether the biology supports that combination. When we look at now which disease to evaluate for now safety and efficacy data, the advisory coalesce and we agree with them to the concept of studying in colorectal cancer. Two main reasons. One is there aren't many drugs approved in the relapsed setting and the currently approved drugs aren't sufficiently effective, at least to the extent that investigators and their patients want. So that was the right place to study a new combination. And also, unfortunately, for the patient, but certainly it helps, the readout is readily quick. We will have over a short period of time, some assessment on whether the combination is providing the outcome we're looking for. 
Now you ask me what is that outcome that we will consider favorable. Again, that was discussed with our advisers. And essentially, they point to our -- the data, not our data. With the data currently observed with TKI and chemotherapy and third or later line of regimen. So the response rate is very low, less than 5%. And durability of response or PFS is still very short, measured in only a few months. So anything that can improve on that will be considered positive. So we'll think about a response rate, if possible, that is in the double digit instead of single digit. That will be certainly a positive outcome and/or an improvement in PFS say, by a doubling to just give an example. So that's kind of what we're aiming at as far as outcome. But of course, it's going to be data driven. 
And then finally, you asked me about when would we have the data from that study. So as I mentioned, we're running the trial in 2 cohorts. The initial cohort, we anticipate to have the initial readout towards the end of this year. And then after that, it will be data for the next cohort next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. You had this high-powered group of experts come together. Obviously, Avastin is used in other diseases as they prioritize the list, where do you go next after colorectal cancer? And how many places do you think you might be able to evaluate the combination of ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Excellent question, Nick. The first step is colorectal cancer. And of course, with positive readout, we're going to focus on colorectal cancer as a development path. But it doesn't mean that it has to be the only development path. Other disease that were discussed would be potentially in renal cell cancer in combination with oral TKI. 
And certainly, in my view, there's still a huge unmet need in glioblastoma, where bevacizumab is approved with or without lomustine, but the results are still not sufficient to what we would like to have for our patients. So another probably will be in glioblastoma, for example. And that's only a few. And of course, they will be driven by where we see the current data take us. And then also, we are considering some preclinical studies to conduct that may help orient us to what other diseases we could go to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nicholas M. Abbott,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Former Director & Equity Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And beyond other diseases, how about other combinations, obviously, checkpoint inhibitors, a backbone of cancer therapy, chemotherapy remains part of that backbone. How do you think about combining beyond VEGF TKIs?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least for one combination, we've already presented nonclinical data with collaborator MD Anderson and Wayne State. It's in combination with venetoclax in AML. It's been presented at AACR, I think, a year ago, 1.5 years ago. And then (inaudible) now is accepted in the peer-reviewed journal, where we see a synergy with the combination in AML -- so that is one example of the combination that it goes beyond the TKI. Certainly, we're interested also with checkpoint inhibitor. And that would be an attractive approach but need to be tested first in preclinical model before we go into the clinic. But certainly, it's an interest to us.

Well, thank you, Dr. Ghalie. We've run out of time. So look forward to data sets emerging this year and into next year, and good luck to you and the team. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard G. Ghalie,  MEI Pharma, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Nick. We really appreciate your good questions. And we'll look forward to present data, as I mentioned, when they're available. And with that, now I would like to turn it to David Urso to take it and conclude the meeting.
