Thank you, Corey. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Yesterday, we issued a news release announcing that Leading BioSciences, and Seneca Biopharma completed the merger transaction to form Palisade Bio. Today, we began trading on NASDAQ Capital Markets under the ticker symbol P-A-L-I or PALI. We are thrilled to achieve this tremendous milestone today.
Now today, I'll be talking about the transaction, why it is such a transformative event for both companies and their stockholders. First, let me briefly provide details about the structure and terms of the transaction, and then I'll focus today's presentation on an overview of Palisade Bio's unique approach to targeting diseases that arise from the gastrointestinal track and our lead drug candidate, LB1148. And then we'll have a brief question-and-answer session.
As noted, Leading BioSciences has completed its merger with Seneca Biopharma to form Palisade Bio. The company's stock is trading on NASDAQ Capital Markets under the ticker symbol PALI effective today. We believe our public listing will position us for proper capitalization and broader visibility within the investment community. Pro forma ownership is 25.7% Seneca and 73 -- 74.3% Leading BioSciences. Concurrently, we received $20 million in a financing led by Altium Growth Capital Funds, which we believe provides sufficient cash runway to achieve key clinical and regulatory milestones.
Leading BioSciences' management team will continue to lead the merged company. Palisade will focus on developing therapeutics for a broad range of GI disorders and complications. Our lead asset, LB1148, has demonstrated the potential to improve restoration of normal GI function following major surgery and reduced certain postoperative complications such as abdominal adhesions.
Notably, LB1148 has shown a 30% or more improvement in the time to return of bowel function following surgery. And we expect to launch a pivotal Phase III study, evaluating GI recovery in neonates undergoing open-heart surgery, later this year. Our second asset, PB101, is currently in preclinical development for inflammatory bowel disease.
Now I would like to walk you through a more detailed overview of Palisade Bio and our promising pipeline of oral therapies for GI complications. We believe that this will highlight why our successful merger provides a compelling foundation for future success for all stakeholders.
As I noted, the Leading BioSciences management team, which has extensive experience in this space and has a proven track record of success, will lead the merged company following this transaction. And we are thrilled to continue to advance our pipeline of novel therapeutics through development and into potential commercialization with Palisade Bio.
Palisade Bio's therapeutic focus is on pathologies caused by loss of gastrointestinal epithelial barrier integrity and the resulting consequences to human health. We have developed an R&D platform technology to develop protease-targeted therapeutics. On this platform technology, we're creating a broad pipeline to treat complications from GI barrier disruption with proprietary formulations of GI protease-targeted therapeutics.
Our lead oral serine protease inhibitor is expected to begin a pivotal clinical trial in the second half of 2021, with proven clinical benefits in multiple surgical studies. We expect our pipeline to lead to several key clinical and regulatory milestones that may drive value creation over the next 12 to 18 months.
Palisade Bio will focus on broad GI disorders and complications related to a compromised GI epithelial barrier. With our lead drug candidate, LB1148, we're addressing 2 key indications: first is return of bowel function following heart and GI surgery; and the second is prevention of postsurgical abdominal adhesions.
For return of bowel function, which is a postoperative complication that can extend hospital length of stay, we are completing a Phase II GI surgery study in adults and expect to soon launch a Phase II/III study in neonatal cardiovascular surgery. We are also actively pursuing earlier-stage programs all focused on protease inhibition.
For today's call, we will focus most of the attention on our late-stage LB1148 program. As I mentioned, there are 2 separate indications for LB1148: one is accelerating the return of postocular GI function; and the second is to reduce postsurgical adhesions.
After many different types of major surgery, the bowels can take a long time to recover and to begin working again. In fact, it's this return of bowel function that is often the rate-limiting criteria in how quickly a patient is able to leave the hospital after surgery. If bowel function returns faster, patients can often leave the hospital sooner.
The national average for hospital expenses per inpatient day is about $2,400. So by accelerating the return of GI function, we were able to shorten the patient's hospital stay, which can lead to obvious and significant cost savings.
Data from 2 clinical studies now suggest that LB1148 may lead to a potential shorter hospital stay by allowing the GI tract to return to its normal function more quickly than it otherwise would, a benefit we plan to expand upon with our pivotal Phase III program.
Before we dive into our clinical programs, I want to describe how postoperative complications can be driven by intestinal proteolytic activity. You see, normally, the intestinal mucosal barrier maintains these exceptionally potent digestive enzymes in -- within the lumen of the intestine. However, the barrier can be compromised as a result of injury, particularly injuries related to surgery or hypoperfusion. This leads to an inflammatory cascade and subsequent damage to the healthy tissues.
When the healthy intestine's mucosal barrier is compromised, either by physical or metabolic injury, it results in an escape, a leakage or translocation of digestive enzymes, also called proteases. These proteases seep into the intestinal tissues and the bloodstream, driving a destructive cascade of disease mechanisms. These include an increase in proteolytic activity, microbiome imbalance, tissue damage and a disruption in normal cell signaling. This creates a negative feedback loop that causes further intestinal damage and exacerbates the postoperative complication, such as delayed bowel function, adhesions and inflammation.
After GI and heart surgery, it takes time for the intestines to recover and really return to normal function. Having that first bowel movement, no matter how small or how large, is an absolutely critical step for patients to be able to leave the hospital after their surgery. The escape of these rogue proteases can drive the formation of adhesions as well, and that we'll be talking about later.
The primary focus of Palisade Biotherapeutics will be to inhibit the digestive proteases leaking from the gut during surgery that can cause the damage and delayed return of postoperative bowel function. This unmet need is very well-understood in the medical community and is known as postoperative ileus.
Illustrating how digestive proteases can damage intestinal tissues, here are data from a preclinical study in rodents that were subjected to a brief hypoperfusion and injury. This is analogous to the loss of blood flow that a patient would experience while on a cardiac bypass pump during common open-heart surgeries.
This is an instance where a picture is worth 1,000 words. In the control group on the left-hand side, you can see the proteases nearly completely digested the villi, completely removing the epithelial cells and causing damage to the underlying tissues, including the musculature and the nerves acquired for normal motility of the intestinal tract.
As you'll see on the right-hand side, animals treated with LB1148 have pristine-looking tissue architecture. The intestinal epithelial cells are completely intact, the barriers protect it, and the underlying issues show no signs of damage or inflammation from proteolytic activity.
These differences are quantified in the study on the right-hand panel of the slide, where the control villi are nearly 75% digested, while the villi from animals treated with LB1148 are most completely intact. We believe this tissue protection is responsible. It's responsible for the improvements in bowel function that we've observed both in the animal studies and in human studies.
To address these serious postoperative complications, we've created LB1148. This is a proprietary, patent-protected formulation of an oral liquid serine protease inhibitor tranexamic acid. It's formulated in already FDA-approved components. Patients drink LB1148 in conjunction with surgery to coat the intestinal mucosal barrier and protect the intestines during surgery and during these hypoperfusion injuries. LB1148 is staged for regulatory success as its components have established safety profiles, and we plan to utilize the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for regulatory approval.
Currently, the only other drug approved for accelerating the return of postoperative GI function is ENTEREG. LB1148 has the potential to be the first drug approved for this indication since ENTEREG's approval in 2008. And importantly, we think LB1148 may have significant advantages over ENTEREG, as I'll highlight here.
As I mentioned, ENTEREG is currently the only drug for accelerating the return of postoperative GI function. But it has notable limitations, including a black box warning for severe side effects, including a fourfold increase in heart attacks. Due to these serious side effects, it is utilized in relatively few hospitals, rendering the pressing unmet medical need for new treatments like LB1148 and at the end of the day, improve, we believe, improve the return of postoperative GI function.
And importantly, and I cannot stress this enough, LB1148 works via a completely different mechanism of action that appears to avoid the safety concerns of ENTEREG. But there are some great things about a competitor like ENTEREG. First is that ENTEREG laid the groundwork and it showed us the precedent pathway for FDA and regulatory approval. It showed us how to design the clinical trials. They had the FDA agree to the approval end point in bowel function. And now our team at Palisade Bio can use their clinical and regulatory footsteps to guide us towards FDA approval.
At the end of the day, we believe that LB1148 has the potential to help address this large unmet medical need with a drug whose components have well-characterized and acceptable safety profiles. Ultimately, we hope LB1148 could become the standard of care in the surgical setting.
So next, I'll describe the clinical data state and the path to FDA for -- the path for LB1148 to commence Phase III clinical studies. Again, I would like to stress that we have 1 drug with 2 indications: accelerating the return of postoperative bowel function; and reducing postsurgical abdominal adhesions.
In 2 completed clinical studies, LB1148 has demonstrated a clinical benefit with a 30% and 48% improvement in time to return of bowel function after cardiovascular and GI surgery, respectively. This translated to a 1.1- to 1.3-day reduction in hospital length of stay and thus conversely could result in significant cost savings potential, if approved. With potentially 6.7 million addressable patients in the U.S. alone, LB1148 has tremendous potential.
Next, I would like to focus on the data and the path to approval for cardiovascular surgery. It is important to remember that the damage done to the bowel from these surgeries is due to hypoperfusion injury that results from patients being on the cardiopulmonary bypass pump. And for those who are unfamiliar with the term, hypoperfusion means that the tissues are starved for blood flow and oxygen while the patient is on the pump.
This was the study designed for our completed Phase II study in cardiovascular surgery. It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigator-sponsored study in 120 subjects undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients received LB1148 or a placebo in conjunction with surgery. The study's primary end point was time to return of bowel function following the surgery. We followed up with patients for a total of 30 days to assess ICU and hospital length of stay and other secondary end points.
This slide shows what we believe are the most compelling data that we have so far. It helps us believe that LB1148 can have a meaningful impact on accelerating return of bowel function and shortening hospital stays. We achieved the primary end point with a highly statistically significant p-value of less than 0.001. The plot to the left shows the return of bowel function following open-heart surgery in the form of a Kaplan-Meier curve. Each time a patient has a bowel movement and achieved the end point, there's an uptick in the line. The median time to bowel recovery was 32 hours for LB1148 and 45 hours, placebo. This is a highly statistically significant 30% improvement and the same end point that we plan to utilize in Phase III.
In addition, for secondary end points, we observed a 1-day reduction in ICU length of stay and a 1.1-day reduction in hospital length of stay. These were not statistically significant, but the study was not powered to observe efficacy on these secondary end points of length of stay.
As from a safety perspective, LB1148 was well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile that has shown no treatment-related adverse events. This 30% improvement in return of bowel function following LB1148 treatment and open-heart surgery compares favorably with ENTEREG, which was able to secure FDA approval based on demonstrating a 16% improvement in return of bowel function following GI surgery.
Moving on to Phase III. We will conduct a pivotal study in cardiac surgery to improve return of bowel function in neonates undergoing open-heart surgery to correct congenital heart defects. There is a tremendous need here for improving GI recovery, as a lack of GI function delays the return to full feeding for these patients.
You see, a newborn after surgery -- for a newborn after surgery, feeding is critical for recovery. Feeding provides nutrition and allows the infant to gain weight. The return to full feeding is a key criteria for an infant to be discharged from an intensive care unit. And the delayed feeding allows -- delayed feeding following neonatal heart surgery is linked to developmental delays, lower IQ, neurological disorders, ADHD and autism.
This market includes about 18,000 neonates undergoing on-pump open-heart surgery annually in the United States. Further, infants undergoing heart surgery are at risk of potential fatal complications of necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC. Neonates who develop NEC are nearly 30 -- add nearly 30 days to their hospital stay and an extra $180,000 in medical costs. We believe that by protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier with LB1148, we may accelerate a return of GI function and the full feeding to minimize the risk of developmental delays and NEC.
From a regulatory and commercial perspective, neonatal open-heart surgery is an attractive first indication for LB1148. The program has potential for important regulatory advantages, including rare pediatric disease exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation and expedited review. This indication may further benefit from enthusiastic investigators in the clinical studies and is positioned for strong product launch to drive commercial success, particularly with the potential alignment of incentives for both payers and providers.
We're currently finalizing the protocol with the FDA for a Phase III neonatal cardiovascular surgery trial. We anticipate it will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, with 100 neonates undergoing elective on-pump surgery to correct congenital heart defects. We plan to follow up patients for 90 days to assess the end points of GI function, return to normal feeding, length of ICU and hospital stay and the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.
We anticipate initiating a Phase III trial later this year, with final data expected in 2022. We anticipate the first 10 patients will participate in an open-label run-in, and we plan to disclose data from those patients by comparing their outcomes to the established standard of care.
In the upcoming section, I'll focus on the data and the path to approval for gastrointestinal surgery. It is important to keep in mind that, for this section, it is the physical injury, the incisions in and the manipulation of the bowel that leads to the escape of digestive proteases and a subsequent enzymatic damage to the bowel that we believe causes the delayed return of function.
Our GI surgery study was an open-label, investigator-sponsored, single-arm study with 10 subjects undergoing elective GI surgery. As with our heart surgery study, the primary end point was the time to return of bowel function following the surgery. We followed up patients for a total of 30 days to assess the length of hospital stay, bowel obstruction and hospital readmittance.
Notably, this study design also provides a second data readout in a second indication, adhesions, as notated by the second red star on the slide. We assess the development and severity adhesions at the time of second surgeries, which I will discuss in greater detail shortly.
For our open-label GI surgery study, we observed a 2.3-day reduction or a 48% improvement in the time to return of bowel function compared with ENTEREG historical placebo control. And no treatment-related adverse events were reported. The placebo arm of ENTEREG's pivotal study showed approximately 4 days to recover GI function compared to our 2.4 days for this GI surgery study.
Not only did we accelerate the return of bowel function with LB1148 treatment, but we also observed a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospital stay by 1.3 days. In other words, this means that patients were discharged 1.3 days sooner than their expected length of hospital stay. Now these expectations were prespecified upon the patient's procedure billing code at the time the patient was admitted for surgery.
For our second data readout in the study, we evaluated adhesion formation after the initial GI surgery. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form during the healing process and can connect organs and tissues that are not normally connected. These adhesions can cause organ strangulation, chronic pain and potentially life-threatening surgical emergencies. Adhesions can be a major complication of abdominal and gynecological surgery and have been observed in up to 85% to 95% of procedures, with 6% to 10% requiring surgical intervention to remove the adhesion.
Post-surgical adhesions can result in a number of health complications. They are the #1 cause of secondary female infertility. They are #1 cause of bowel obstruction. And they are the #10 cause of emergency surgery. Complications from post-surgical adhesions lead to over $2.3 billion in health care costs annually.
Here are the data from an animal study demonstrating a 63% reduction in post-surgical adhesions. In this study, animals went a -- underwent a surgical procedure to resect a 2-centimeter piece of bowel and were allowed to recover for 7 weeks. As these images demonstrate, analysts treated with the vehicle have extensive adhesion formations that led to abnormal bowel movement and inflammatory pathology. You can see that the animals treated with LB1148 had normal GI anatomy and the absence of pathological adhesions. This is quantified in the graph on the right-hand side of the panel, with a statistically significant 63% reduction in adhesions in the LB1148 group.
From our GI surgery study, we had 3 patients who underwent a second surgery for complications unrelated to adhesions. This provided an opportunity to examine the effect of LB1148 on adhesion formation. In all 3 patients, there were no adhesions observed, 0. This is a striking result.
The surgeon leading the study remarked that he has performed thousands of abdominal surgeries, and he was astounded by the absence of adhesions in these 3 follow-up patients. We believe these results support the hypothesis that LB1148 has the potential to be a transformative oral treatment to prevent adhesions.
So let's talk about the competitive landscape for adhesion prevention. There is a significant need for new treatment options for post-surgical adhesions. ADEPT, for example, is an FDA-approved treatment for the reduction of postsurgical adhesions and was approved based on a clinical study in which there was only a 10% difference between ADEPT and placebo in the number of patients reporting a success, defined as a decrease in 3 or more sites of adhesions.
We are encouraged by FDA's approval of ADEPT with these results. We anticipate that as an oral drug, LB1148 may have many advantages to ADEPT in other surgical barriers, others that are regulated as medical devices implemented in the operating room. These can lengthen surgical duration and the time patients are under anesthesia. To our knowledge, LB1148 is the only oral drug in development for the reduction of intra-abdominal adhesions.
We've begun enrollment of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study in GI surgery and expect to enroll a total of 120 to 200 subjects. There are 2 key data readouts in the study for the 2 approvable indications. The primary end point is, for the first indication, is the time to return of GI function, with secondary end points evaluating hospital length of stay and the time to resolution of postoperability.
The end point for the second indication is the reduction of postsurgical adhesions. As in our previous GI surgery, in this Phase II study for patients undergoing a second surgery, there will be an assessment for the presence or absence of adhesion and their impact on bowel function and postoperative pain.
Now let's talk about the commercial opportunity for LB1148. One of the driving forces behind our program is to present a clear and compelling case for cost savings for the health care system. Shortening hospital length of stay is an obvious way to do that. In fact, these end points are built into our planned Phase III programs. This provides a compelling value proposition across the health care system. LB1148 has a well-characterized safety profile. The oral at-home dosing is convenient for both patients and surgeons, and it has the potential to reduce health care costs and improve margins, while potentially improving long-term patient outcomes. If these key benefits are achieved, we expect that they will drive widespread adoption of LB1148, if approved.
I would like to go over some of the key aspects of the potential patient journey and buying process for patients receiving LB1148 for a major surgery. In the weeks before surgery, a patient will go to a pre-op physical at the surgeon's clinic. At that time, they will receive a prescription for LB1148, which will be filled at the local pharmacy, where we believe and anticipate LB1148 may be covered on the patient's pharmacy benefit. We believe this is a key to the buying process.
The patient should then take LB1148 at home before arriving at hospital for surgery. Following surgery, we expect LB1148 may accelerate the return -- to return of bowel function so that a patient can be discharged from the hospital sooner and finish the recovery time at home.
I don't think we have to convince you that this is a tremendous market. There are about 1.1 million open-heart surgeries and about 5.6 million abdominal surgeries each year in the U.S. alone. A 20% to 40% market share could equate to more than $2 billion annually. Our commercial strategy would include marketing to the 5,000 U.S. hospitals. We plan to partner, ex U.S. territories, and in fact, have already a co-development agreement partnership with Newsoara for commercial rights to China. And as an imperator for M&A value, last year, Baxter acquired Sanofi's Seprafilm medical device for $350 million or approximately 3.5x sales.
So to conclude, we've made great progress so far and are thrilled to have completed this transformative merger and look forward to continuing to build on this momentum as Palisade Bio. We expect several upcoming milestones in the course of 2021. We expect to initiate a Phase II/III study in neonatal cardiac surgeries later this year. And we'll be expecting multiple data readouts and regulatory milestones over the ensuing 12 months. We expect that data from the first 10 patients should read out in 2021.
We believe that we continue to create and capture value for stockholders and patients over the years to come as we advance our programs through clinical testing. Our robust pipeline includes several late-stage clinical trials that have potential to address a number of important unmet medical needs related to broad GI disorders and complications. We look forward to expanding our product pipeline of novel treatment options for pathologies caused by the loss of GI epithelial barrier integrity in the months and years ahead.
Finally, I would like to thank the participating patients and investigator teams for their continued support. We are excited to march ahead as Palisade Bio to develop novel therapeutics for major unmet needs.
With that, I would like to turn it back over to the operator to provide instructions for you to ask questions.
