--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Everett. I appreciate everybody taking the time to get a little bit more in-depth on the Green Roads' acquisition. Obviously, it's an exciting opportunity for Valens and Green Roads to come together to make a very solid foundation as an organization growth. So with the acquisition, it represents our first piece of the puzzle for our U.S. strategy. Obviously, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in the U.S., and there's a ton of opportunity to be had. So what we're trying to do is basically go in there and vertically integrate, bring new products and new verticals and bring our capabilities to the U.S. market. So what you'll see over the next little bit is more activity in the U.S. 
So what we want to do is enter the U.S. as an allied, not an enemy. And I think what we're going to do is bring our manufacturing capabilities down there in a meaningful way and then really start to set up some MSO distribution relationships a lot of you know, my background is actually from the U.S. in the early days, especially the Colorado market. So a lot of my network is kind of -- got its tentacles all over the U.S. right now. So we expect to see some meaningful relationships come very, very quickly. Another thing I'll touch on briefly before I turn it over to Dale is the NASDAQ listing. 
Obviously, on the back of a U.S. transaction. We believed it was time to go to the NASDAQ. We're excited about the opportunity to bring additional shareholder value and liquidity. The big model we're sticking by Valens is fewer, bigger, better. So we're excited, and then you're going to see a lot of exciting things come from us. So Dale, why don't you take it away?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Tyler, and good morning. Let me start off by just saying the entire Green Roads team is very excited to be joining with the folks from Valens. I think we've got a very experienced team, and I'll get into that in a little bit. To give you just a little bit of my background. I'm an agreed mechanical engineer from Virginia Tech. I did my MBA at Duke University. When I left Duke, I went and joined General Electric Company, and I was with GE on the manufacturing side of the business for a number of years. And then I moved into GE Capital. And I finished my career as Senior Vice President of GE Capital, In charge of Corporate Finance. I ran the offices in New York, Chicago, Las Vegas and Dallas. 
I left GE to lead the acquisition of the assets of an airline called Eastern Airlines, and we're able to purchase those assets out of bankruptcy go and subsequently start-up what became the world's largest aftermarket aircraft parts company. We went from 0 to about $700 million in 7 years. After that, I've had a chance to become the President and CEO of several different companies, 7 in a row in the last 30 years. The last 2 of which I think are probably most meaningful for our opportunity today. The last one was a company called Cyalume Technologies. It was a specialty chemical company. We did manufacture. We had an FDA-approved environment for the major pharmaceutical companies. We had manufacturing both in Europe and in the U.S. The company I ran before that was the largest privately held lead gen company in the United States. And we took that from $30 million to $380 million of revenue in about 3 years, with EBITDA of about $83 million. And the reason that I think that, that's so relevant for opportunity together with Valens is we need to be a powerhouse, not only out at selling in the different distribution centers, but also online. And I think one of the values we hope to bring to the table here is a very sophisticated online strategy. So we're very excited to be here. And I think the company going forward is going to be a very exciting one. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Dale. And maybe I'll take the conversation back a second here and to -- from a Valens perspective. And we've been very upfront with investors when we were looking at the U.S. market. There were several structural challenges that we saw in approaching the U.S. market. The first was limitations on our ability to access the THC side of the business given our public listing. And the other was related to the structure of the market in the U.S. and the undisciplined product forms in terms of quality and consistency that we saw in the market. And we saw those as 2 challenges, and we continued to do our work and well over a year. We've analyzed and reviewed the opportunities and developed our strategy. Then we came across Green Roads, which ultimately was the perfect fit for us in addressing those structural challenges on the first hand, but secondly, providing an ideal platform for our accelerated growth into the market as it continued to evolve and as things like THC came online and became legal in the U.S. 
I say perfect fit because the Green Roads' focus on not only quality, but consistency is unmatched in the U.S. market. So if you think about all of the challenges from the product forms, whether -- how much CBD do they contain and you get a consistency from ball to bottle. It's very, very challenging to build a brand in that context. Green Road does not have that challenge. As you see here in some of our materials, the #2 brand ranked by market share in the market as a private company. So that speaks to the quality and the consistency available through the Green Roads platform. 
Also from a cultural perspective, very, very strong. And hopefully, you'll see as our investor base here, as Dale speaks, and as we talk together as a team here, a very, very strong cultural link and focus on quality, consistency and innovation in the market that permeates through both of our organizations and culminates with the fact that our Valens model as we look to continue to grow in the Canadian space has always been its personal. And not coincidentally, the Green Roads model has also been its personal because we both believe fundamentally that the enjoyment of cannabis, the use of cannabis and the benefits of cannabis are personal. They're related to each person individually, and we're very excited to align with the management team that has that same view. 
As we look at the strategic benefits, Everett will get into more of the synergies and more specifics as we go through. But some highlights at this point before we really get into the meat of things. Number one, obviously, the U.S. The largest cannabinoid market in the world. The Valens' ambition is to be a global cannabis products company. So obviously, we need a strong presence in the U.S. Secondly, we don't just want to enter any way. We want to enter with the way we have with Green Roads with a strong brand that's well-positioned and growing in terms of share in the market, and we got that through Green Roads' proven management team. Not only are they more than capable of growing the Green Roads business and building out and realizing on the opportunities that we see today, we also think they're well-positioned to continue to add-on and grow other opportunities in the U.S. with that management team. 
And lastly, they're head office is located out of Florida, which is one of the more progressive cannabinoid states in the U.S. So starting from a local market and a talent pool and an opportunity perspective that we find attractive. 
Next slide, Courtney. From a transaction perspective, we really believe we've threaded the needle here and came up with a transaction that was very attractive for both shareholders. And as this market will understand, that's very hard to do. Firstly, we structured a transaction that's very accretive for Valens shareholders and provides a tremendous opportunity for us. But also provides a great opportunity for the Green Roads shareholders, not only in terms of upfront value, but also in terms of an ability to profit or benefit from their continued performance in the business plan that they've worked so hard over the last couple of years to put in place. And so that earn-out structure really providing and aligning -- providing opportunity and aligning interest as a management team. The structure is $25.4 million upfront, that consists of $14.6 million in cash and the rest in Valens shares. Sorry, excuse me, that's $25 million in Valens shares and $14.6 million in cash and then provides a $20 million opportunity for an earn-out as Green Roads continues to operate and realize on the EBITDA opportunity that they have in their business plan, and that Valens fundamentally believes will be available to them in 2022. 
Of course, when you're issuing balancers in the context of acquisitions, there will be extended lockup provisions to ensure we can continue alignment and the transaction is looking to close in June of this year after we go through customary closing conditions in the market. 
Next slide. And to be clear, as we're looking at the U.S. opportunity, obviously, without THC, that's one side of our business. But when you look at the CBD side, we really do fundamentally believe there's a strong market opportunity for us simply on the CBD side, we see an opportunity to drastically grow our addressable market. And as the U.S. market continues to mature from a CBD side and the quality, consistency and brand reputation that Green Roads has we believe that the business is positioned for taking more than its fair share of that market as it continues to grow and as the market continues to mature. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Dale to go into more detail on the Green Roads business. Dale?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate that. Guys, we're the leading privately held CBD company in the United States. And you heard Jeff talk earlier about the alignment and the focus on quality. To us that, that has always been the primary focus. We believe we developed innovative products with the highest quality and traceability that the market will come to us and we'll be successful. We led and pioneered and been pushed for the regulations to require QR codes on all the packaging. And we were the first to go out and put a bar code label on all of our products but if you go and take your cell phone and scan our label or the QR code, rather, you can go right to a lab report and see the traceability back to the original product that was used in the manufacturing. So we sort of led the industry. We weren't real popular initially when we did that because we kind of dragged the rest of the industry along. We thought it helped both our company and the entire industry in terms of the overall credibility in the marketplace. 
We manufacture 80% of our own products, and we're in an FDA CGMP approved facility down in Doral, Florida, we manufacture products that are OTC approved. And we're just working now to expand our product offerings of OTC offerings. We offer the full spectrum of products. We have everything from capsules to topicals to creams, to edibles and more. And I think we're continually looking for opportunities to continue to expand that product line. 
Our distribution center is here in Deerfield Beach, Florida. And we are technologically a very integrated company. I think if you go on our website, you'll see Microsoft gave us an award for the implementation of their D 365 as the outstanding implementation last year. They've written a case study about our company in terms of the way to go and properly install the ERP package. But we brought in, and I mentioned that I was in one of the largest lead generation companies in the U.S. I brought a number of my team members from that, including our CTO on board here. And we have built out what I believe in our industry is the most sophisticated technology stack for going through, receiving orders, advertising and measuring our spend the return that we're getting online. 
So we started that right at the middle of COVID. We put millions of dollars into getting it often implemented, sort of fought our way through the collapse of the marketplace and kept that persevering in terms of positioning ourselves to have the success online. And I think we're just now getting ready to turn that on and bring that up to speed. And we think that's going to produce tremendous results for us. So I feel very confident on that, and I've been very fortunate in being able to pull on to our team 4 or 5 key players that were with me before when we grew our online business. 
Next slide, please, Courtney. We have an excellent senior management team. I think we punch way above our weight in terms of experience. Our founder, Laura Fuentes, was a pharmacist for 25 years. And when I first came down and we had sold the last company that I had run to private equity, and I came back to South Florida and thought I was going to place some tennis and golf. And our attorneys introduced me to Laura. And I went out and spent 20 minutes with her at a Starbucks hearing her talk about her company. And I've worked for private equity for a number of years and a number of companies. And the conversation there is always pretty simple. How long will it take us to triple revenues and bring the bottom line up by 5x. And for 20 minutes, Laura talked about how many people our product had helped and how good our product was and the opportunity for us to continue to help people and the fact that we have 9,000 thank you letters from people and families telling us how it's helped their children, or how it's helped them to relieve their pain and so forth. And I got done after 20 minutes, I looked at Laura, he said, do you guys make any money, and she kind of shook her head and said, yes, absolutely. But with her as our leader and I think sort of our spiritual True North, you can see the company's focus is on quality and helping people. And I think we accomplished that, that the business will grow. 
John Wazowicz, who's our Chief Financial Officer, has been an experienced financial guy for 20 years. He had worked with me 15, 20 years ago at the aviation company. I may have helped to bring him in. He was key with our Chief Technology Officer and helping to lay out the micro help choose the Microsoft D365 system to helped get that up and implemented. And that in addition to being the CFO, he's sort of a half CTO as well. So we're really glad to have John in her team. Lee Sosin is our Chief Marketing Officer, he as well is a very experienced guy. He was at senior positions both at Yahoo! and at Hearst. And he is the point person for us with a lot of our online marketing creative so forth. I think the only thing it really frustrates me is as soon as we launch a new creative and so forth, there are people that copy everything he thinks up and does. I keep trying to tell him that forgery is the best compliment he could get, but he's a very smart, very seasoned guide he helps lead our product set and our product development. 
And then Pam Crop. Pam Crop is our inside counsel. She worked at GE for a number of years, led a staff of 25 attorneys at one point. She went to Stanford, graduated with Honors from Stanford. And I would think she is probably one of the smartest cannabis attorneys now that's actually in the country today. 
Next slide, please. I talked about our products and the consistency of our products and our quality. We have spent way less on marketing than everybody else in our industry. But by a lot, we're still the largest privately held company out there and probably the most copied by everyone that's on this list. So we think we're very well-positioned. We think, quite honestly, we're just getting started. And with the merger together with the folks from Valens and the shared value systems and the drive for growth and the commitment to growing their company, we feel like we're home. So we're very excited about where we are in terms of market share. And I think when you talk about having a 2% market share, in a very large market, that there's sort of nothing but upside ahead of us. So we're very excited about the opportunities to take off and go after that. 
Courtney, I'll turn it back to Jeff at this point. Thank you.

Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Dale. It's Everett. I'll jump in here on kind of Slide 11. As Dale mentioned, we're just getting started. And if you look at kind of the synergies of the companies together, we're going to spend a lot of time here because I think this is one of the things that attracted us to the Green Roads team the most. And Jeff talked about its personal. At the beginning, Dale talked about kind of the plan forward, but the first phase of synergies for us is exploiting low-hanging fruit. If you look at the companies, Green Roads today has a CGMP facility. Obviously, we have very good practices of shipping product internationally. And now we have another hub to do that in the CBD market that's less restricted. And then we could use our Canadian operations for the medical channel. I think this is a significant kind of foot forward. And the one thing we share is quality. And I think that's what's attracted to us in the beginning. And now we can do that on a global scale, both in Canada and in the U.S. and in Australia. 
Number two, drive market share. I think together with both of our resources, whether it's the relationships that we can leverage that we have in Canada as well as the Green Roads relationships, I think there's significant opportunity to drive market share. If you look at the fragmented view of fragmented nature of the CBD industry in the U.S. marketplace. I think that quality and knowing your consumer is what wins. And Green Roads has that. And I think we have that. And together, I think you're going to see a lot new distribution channels and expansion of that great market share they've accomplished today. 
Number three is expanded product offerings. I think that there is unique IP that our investors know that we have in Canada, especially on the rare cannabinoids side. And I think that you're going to see a lot of great products kind of come to market, and there's a lot of synergies we can do and really customize it to the consumer experience, which is really what drives that sales force. The segmentation of the portfolio. Obviously, in the Canadian market, we operate in, obviously, lifestyle, health and wellness and medical segments. I think this is a unique synergy where we can bring some of those relationships in the market, and this will transcend not only health and wellness, but pharmaceutical as we make the next kind of generation of products on the marketplace with the same quality. And finally, as I mentioned, international markets. I think this is a key -- it's less rigorous from a regulatory standpoint of shipping CBD internationally. Green Roads is already sophisticated in this, and they've already been shipping to countries around the world. And with our distribution relationships, I think that Green Roads, we can expand the Green Roads brand as one of the best-known CBD brands internationally. 
And then Phase II is really the backward integration in the value chain. Our core expertise, as people know, is that manufacturing. And I think that as these platforms come together, there's significant margin expansion opportunities as we get in there and obviously, the similar focus on quality as well as testing we obviously have a partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the largest analytical testing companies in the world. And I think when you look at testing and the world of testing, I think that Green Roads takes us to heart, and I think we can only build on this and build one of the best platforms from a value chain standpoint, and we can take all the R&D that our investors in Canada like sourced by Valens' emulsion and other different opportunities that I won't give away yet, but we can take those now into the U.S. and have those as a synergy. 
And then finally, Phase III, Jeff mentioned this at the beginning of the call, but there's no mistake that these operations are in for. And I think that if you look at the progressive nature of that industry, upon federally legalization, I think there's a large opportunity there for us in one of the most attractive markets, and that's the first puzzle piece. In kind of our overall kind of U.S. strategy and as that goes. And that affects, obviously, product portfolio, distribution relationships. Obviously, we're very close with a lot of players that are already operating down there. I think that's a unique attribute and obviously, synergy longer-term as well as to speed up kind of both the manufacturing facility on a B2B segment, but also into those different distribution channels upon that opens up. So I think, really, we're just scratching the surface here. And as Dale said, we're just getting started. And we'll give more and more commentary going into close on these synergies and further quantifying them. 
Next slide. So if you look at the capitalization of the companies together, obviously, you have one of the most formidable North American platforms. And if you look at kind of the 2020 revenue of Valens, we did $83.8 million. Green Roads did almost $28 million. So together, you get a company that's $100 million and almost $12 million in overall revenues. And if you look at Green Roads and the COVID restrictions, I think there's significant growth here, and obviously, know there's significant growth in the Valens platform. Now when you look at these companies together and you now look at not only a Canadian peer group as our peer group at a North American peer group, I think there's significant upside for our shareholders as we trade at 1/3 of the North American peer group average. And I think that that's without even the synergies that we chatted about in the last slide. If you look at the overall purchase price of this transaction. Of the $40 million upfront, this would make up less than 1.8x 2020 revenue, which we believe is very attractive for our shareholders as well as Green Roads, fully realizes the earn-out and achieved USD 13.3 million in revenue in 2022. This would be a 4.5x 2022 EBITDA multiple, which is very attractive for our shareholders. And I think that if you look at this business together, obviously, with international synergies, product synergies as well as going eventually into the THC market, I think you have 2 world-class teams coming together. 
Next slide. As Jeff mentioned at the beginning, we have very similar branding, right? We actually have the same logo, and it's personal. And what this means in the concentration here, is that we are a consumer first companies. The reason that we've been successful on Valens is that what we've had is we've had a consumer focus, and that's why we've achieved higher sales velocity than competitors. On the shelves. And what you have is Green Roads has the same concentration of the consumers. And as it's personal, I think, is the reason together, we're going to be even more successful internationally. You have a team at Green Roads that is not only the same passion, but also has the same innovation. And I think together, the synergies are truly unparalleled. Not only do we have the same motto, but the same concentration on that consumer. And I believe that quality products will be the winning point. Long term, and there will be a differentiation, and you're already seeing that happen in Canada and the U.S. and what I want to mention here today is that quality comes first for both of these companies. And I think we can lead the industry in a new standard for this globally together. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator, and what we can do is open the lines for some Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions). Okay, your first question comes from Andrew Partheniou from Stifel GMP.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Partheniou,  Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the transaction, very exciting. If I could start off. Talking about your sales and distribution for Green Roads. Could you give any kind of color on online versus retail sales? What's the percentage difference between the 2? Is it mostly online or mostly retail? And how do you view both channels independently of each other on how to win in each channel?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, Dale, why don't you take that, and then I'll follow-up with my commentary?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, I'd be happy to. So online, let me take the percentages first. Today, we're about 50-50 between our online business and our retail business. We see that going to about between 60% to 65% online. And online is really a question of being able to go out and buy traffic and retain customers. The 2 key measures in the online business is what does it cost me to acquire a customer? And what is that customer worth to make in understanding both the near-term in terms of the initial purchase from the customer and the lifetime value of the customer. And we're just bringing our platform up to speed but our initial first few months, our cost of acquisition of a customer was about $9.7. The value to us with a customer was about $94 in terms of that first purchase. 
So in order to win in that area, it's all technology-driven. It is the ability to measure real time, how much traffic am I getting? Was it costing me to get that traffic? What is that traffic worth to me? And it's a very dynamic process. It involves instantaneous and intraday measurement of what's going on. We have not only the D 365 and Salesforce and big commerce platform, so driving our online business, but we have 25 other pieces of incremental software and some code we've written ourselves internally that will help us to drive the algorithms there and sort of measure what's going on. 
In the store basis, we sort of segregate that out into stores or chains that have 50 or more stores and then the independents or small mom-and-pop shops. We -- today, we have over 7,000 doors that we're in terms of our product out there. But we're starting to win in the big places. We won Publix. And Publix is probably one of the more conservative U.S.-based chains. We're in 820 public stores, working with them to expand to all 1,300 working with them to put more of our SKUs in place. We were in every Hudson news store in the United States. Which was 330 stores. And we were -- they had 5 brands on the shelf. But of their 5 brands, we were 53.8% of sales, which means cumulatively, we were out selling the other 4 brands. 
So the U.S. is really just sort of getting off its back with COVID. And a lot of the large chains had kind of frozen in place until COVID was passed in terms of new planograms and introducing new products. But I think that there's a great opportunity for us to grow in the big chains. Because we're getting a lot of recognition now with publics and Hudson news and a number of others that we've brought in. And then we're back and focusing on different segments of the pharmacy market and the lifestyle market. 
We're very excited because Tyler has a lot of historical relationships for us here in the U.S., and I'm very confident with Tyler's relationships he's got from his past armed with our product set. That we're going to make some early on and low-hanging fruit successes. So I think we were looking to grow as I told you, a lot of my background in addition to chemistry is online, so a huge fan of numbers driving the business by the numbers in the online segment. But I think you'll see us in most of the major grocery store chains as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Just to double down on that. I think Dale hit the nail on the head. My relationships come from physical store locations. So what we've done in the past little while where we're doing due diligence was to start to spread our tentacles into different relationships. So we've already predetermined multiple store locations, and we'll call them Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 opportunities. And then we're going to do some trade marketing activation at physical locations to really start pumping some volumes through those stores. So we're excited about being able to grow our distribution immediately.

          Great color there. And maybe following on that trend, for the retailers, historically, at least when CBD started out in the U.S., they were kind of reluctant to put a lot of different types of products on the shelf, focusing on topicals only because of lack of FDA guidance where do you see the market now in terms of where the retailers or the larger retailers are standing in terms of product preference, what they put on shelves and how do you see that evolving going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So a few things I'll touch on then Everett, I'll probably kick it to you. The biggest thing we've seen in talking with the majority of the big retailers in different verticals, whether it's health and wellness, medical or recreational is trust. So without the trust capability and when what Green Roads has done a very good job of this gaining trust. That's the biggest bottleneck we've seen is if they're really going to get behind the product, are they willing to basically put their name associated with that product and what we're seeing is yet. So Everett, if you want to comment or Dale?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Maybe I'll start, and I'll hand it off to Dale. But I think that's -- it's kind of building on what Tyler said, Andrew, I think from a big box retailer standpoint, really, you look at quality and what Green Roads has is the best quality brands to get in there. And some of the kind of CPG relationships that we're in talks with. I think there's great synergies there in the U.S. as it grows. And I think that the big upside and why this is such a strategic acquisition now is that with cannabis legislation progressing, not only on the THC side, but FDA guidance, which we expect to come at some point here. What that will do is really open up the ingestible segments in those big box retailers. So I think that Green Roads has a dominant position in a great brand names like public Hudson news today. But on FDA kind of further guidance, I think there's even more upside there. And Dale, maybe you want to expand on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, as -- I think adding the edibles quickly is in the mindset of all the big box retailers. And I'll give you evidence of that. We -- about 3 weeks ago, got notice from public that they were taking the product from their test phase into a permanent offering in their store. So and the reason they were telling this is they were building permanent fixtures in all the stores, and they were expanding the shelf length. And the folks from Publix told us, look at we're already planning ahead for your brand. We want to have extra shelf space on there. So we go to add the edibles. We don't have to redo the fixture. So when the folks from the stores are already thinking about building the fixtures to accommodate the edible products, I think we're not far off from that becoming a reality.

          Your next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli from Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerald John Pascarelli,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the deal, very exciting. So my first question is for Dale, and it's actually on the pricing landscape. Over the course of 2020, we had seen some large competitors take 15% to 20% price reductions. In order to manage the gaps, given the notable increase in competition, in particular, at the retail channel. So it's one of the market leaders within this space, we'd like to get some more color on how you think about price gap management and whether or not you're comfortable with your relative price position in the current environment? Any color you could provide there would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Yes, happy to, Gerald. Green Roads has not positioned itself to be the low-priced brand in the marketplace. Quite honestly, our products are different than everybody else's that are there, and we believe our products work better. And because we believe we're the premium brand out there, we don't price chase. We do stay competitive. I'm very mindful of our top 5 competitors pricing in the marketplace. And we have made strategically some reductions in price where we thought the gap between ourselves and the others were was just too great. And recently, we just did that on our large 750-milligram product. So every month, we check competitor pricing. We try to make sure that we are competitive. We believe we deserve and we have been receiving a slight premium over other products because we work better. But at some point that consumer is just going to say, you're just too expensive. So we're very sensitive to that. Part of the reason we vertically integrated into the manufacturing business was to capture the margin associated with manufacturing the products. And about 80% of our products today are in house. 
The reason we did that is we wanted to make sure that if the market ever dropped their pricing down, we could do that and remain not only competitive but profitable. So that was both a strategic but also a future defensive move in case pricing came down. So I think we're very well-positioned. The feedback we get in terms of the surveys and the Bright-field is done and so forth on our product is that people think we're the best value out there. And that's sort of the phrase. If I could get our consumers that continue to repeat to each other, we think Green Roads is the best value there. So I think I like our positioning. But any time you've got CPG products, you better be always looking at your competitors' pricing and how you're positioned. And I think we do a good job of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. A couple of things I'd like to add is when you walk into a liquor store, you're not looking for the cheapest bottle of wine. You're looking for something consistent that you trust that has the same consumer experience. So we're not trying to be the lowest cost producer. We're not trying to be the lowest cost CBD manufacturer in the U.S. We're trying to be the best. So when you look at the value proposition, I don't really care what anybody else is doing because we can put a value product that's consistent on the market. Cheaper than anybody else. So I'm not too concerned about what other people are doing. We're obviously paying close attention in now North America, but we can bring a value proposition that no one else can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And Gerald, may I just ever, maybe to expand on that is also you and I chatted about the difference between that B2B price competition channel, the B2C side online. And what really drove us to Green Roads was the sophistication, as Dale mentioned, on that B2C online strategy. When you look at that, whether you have ROAS, return on advertising spend or the cost of acquisition of a customer, I think Green Roads, from a quality standpoint as well as a metric standpoint is best-in-class, and you can even see some third-party resources of Bright-field where they've grown online almost faster than others through that process, especially over the last kind of 6 months. So I think those also is an advantage as when we look to the future revenue profile of the firm going to that B2C side, I think that's a big advantage for us longer term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerald John Pascarelli,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - VP    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. Super helpful color. My next question is probably for The Valens team. But as I look at the deck here, what are your immediate priorities expand new product offerings, right? And so I guess just some more color around -- as you look at the Green Roads portfolio today, any near-term opportunities that stick out from an innovation perspective? And then how you'll look to leverage your expertise in things like IP and formulations to help drive that innovation to Green Roads immediately and just broadly in general?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, happy to. So I'm not going to give away my playbook. Obviously, one of the biggest synergies, I believe we have is the core competencies core competency, sorry, of manufacturing, and we believe there's some white space. So Jeff, I'll probably kick it over to you if there is anything you do want to touch on, but I'm not going to go in-depth in some of the products we're seeing white space in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So I think for us, without getting into the specifics, it's above priorities. So again, we fully buy into the approach at the Green Roads team and Dale and the team have put in place. We think that on the business on its own provides a tremendous opportunity for the Valens shareholders. If they do nothing else but execute on the business plan, so Phase #1 for us says, make sure that they have everything they need and they're capable and able to start to drive that. Secondly, it's about, as we've chatted about making introductions, increasing those distribution channels for those products that they already have in as we're looking at the market and assessing the product opportunities and what we want to launch into those various products. Do we launch some of our own manufacturing in there is it economical to leverage somebody else in the market in the short term? What specific products do you want to go after first, but it's a growth phase. It happens over a period of months and quarters here. But suffice it to say that the opportunity to do that, we think, is substantial sort of -- and following that for that sort of playbook.

          Your next question comes from Neal Gilmer from Haywood Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neal Gilmer,  Haywood Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst of Special Situations    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Perhaps my main question is to Dale. Part of your prepared remarks, you talked about how you've been able to accomplish the 2% market share while significantly underspending your peer group with respect to marketing and so forth. Can you give us a little bit more sense? You touched on it maybe a little bit to the first question here. But kind of how you've achieved that market share, given your tight marketing budgets and sort of where you see your capabilities for taking that forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks, Neal. I think the thing that helps us is customer retention. Our marketing team says, once you try us, you'll never leave us. And I think that has a lot to do with it when customers come in and just our lifetime value of customers and customers staying. The other thing that we've been doing is acquiring customers through affiliate marketing and things like that, where we pay but only upon a sale. What's called CPA or cost per acquisition. And it allows us to go out and work with affiliates that have newsletters that do online pay-per-click marketing that have their own SEO related to their own activities. But again, it costs us nothing except a percentage of spend. So there's no real marketing that was put out there. It's just paying people to drive traffic to us. 
We have built a very sophisticated online strategy related to and we shared some numbers where we think we are 1 of the leading SEO companies in our industry. And then we have a very high percentage of just type-in traffic. And I love type-in traffic, and I love SEO because the cost per acquisition of the customer is so low. So we have not gone out and done the traditional kind of spending on customer acquisition that a lot of our other people have done. We think that others in the industry, and this is a little bit bold, but they haven't done it right. They've gone off and to spend money sort of blindly buying traffic into their sites, hoping they get conversions. And you can do that, but you can end up like a number of the publicly traded competitors with burning a hole in your pocket. Our intent is to go out and we have -- and we're just finishing the development of very sophisticated mathematical targeting algorithms that does what they call cohort analysis. It goes through and does a comparison mathematically of who is buying Green Roads products and who do we think is most likely to buy Green Roads products and it allows us to go online target our advertising in a very, very narrow way to the people that we can prove mathematically and statistically have the highest predilection to want to make a purchase of Green Roads products. 
So I could bore you to tears for hours with taking you through that. But I think as time goes on, we'll be able to come back to you and back up with history that we've been able to successfully go online and do that, quite honestly, I guess just using good math and good targeting. So I think in the past, we've been successful with literally almost nothing that raw marketing dollars out there. And I'm very confident in terms of our approach of what we're going to do. We grew our online business before, which was lead gen for financial service products and flowers and all kinds of other things, and we grew that from $30 million to well over $300 million in 3 years very profitably. And the market -- I think the market is waiting for us to get there. There's nobody out there that I see, and I know a little bit about online marketing that's doing a great job of it. So I look forward for us getting the opportunity to go there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And so Neal, I also think if I can just make one more point on that. This is -- you're starting to see the cultural alignment. From a balance perspective, we have one of the highest ROICs in the space. Because we don't just spend money and hope things materialize. We target opportunities that we know in the short-term are going to drive value. Green Roads is a perfect example of this, but that same sort of philosophy on how to spend a dollar permeates through green growth as well. So this is just -- I just wanted to highlight one example of that cultural alignment that I chatted about earlier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neal Gilmer,  Haywood Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst of Special Situations    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Helpful. My one follow-up, maybe again, the comment was that you're manufacturing 80% of your own products to make sure you capture that margin on that manufacturing. Are there plans to take that to 100%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think we're always looking at those opportunities. Again, I think Jeff had said it and Tyler as well. We now have a mindset of making sure that if we go to do that, not only it strategically accomplishes what we want to, but it's going to have to be something that we do that's accretive to the valence shareholders. We've looked at a lot of companies out there. And well, I think there's a lot of potential to do that through acquisition, it would have to be something that makes sense. We have taken a look at just building out in-house our own edibles line for making gummies and some other products. There's some great equipment that we looked at in Europe that we'll do that. So I think the door is open for us to continue to expand that further just through bringing it up and manufacturing it in-house ourselves. So I think we'll continue to evaluate that. We always look at the make buy. And right now, given all the opportunities we have on our plate, it makes sense for us to continue to buy it, but it's never far from our thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaan Mir,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the deal. My first question is just to touch on the capacity a bit at the two Florida locations. Is there anything that you can provide in terms of that capacity? And if not exact numbers, could you maybe outline where they're operating today in terms of reaching full capacity and the ability to scale within the existing infrastructure, especially when you're considering the global angle there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, Dale, why don't you talk about that one?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks, Tyler. Yes, our facility in Doral currently is meeting all the Green Roads' needs. We run 4.5 days a week, 1 shift. So we think we have great upside just within the 4 walls of where we are today. The Deerfield distribution facility from a racking standpoint is at about 50% capacity. And with improved turn of products on the shelf, we probably have over 300% increased capacity coming out of the facility. The facility is semi-automated which is when we get an invoice that prints coming out of our order system, we get a pick ticket, pick ticket has a barcode on it. Our pickers have barcode readers in their hands. It tells them exactly where to go. They scan each product in, put it in the bin, it goes down to our outbound quality. They scan the orders, scan each item. So our accuracy outbound is very high, better than 99%. And so I think we have the ability to scale, both in terms of by going to 3 shifts a day, but also putting another pick and ship line in if we had to. So I think we're well positioned to support the growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaan Mir,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          All right. My next question is just looking at the revenue composition a bit. I think it was said that last year, Green Roads did about $27 million, $28 million of revenue. I just wanted to get an understanding of if there was any sort of B2B manufacturing baked into that versus kind of the sale through of the owned brand line? And then on the back of that, is there kind of any understanding or cadence that you could provide looking forward in terms of developing the B2B wholesale side of the operation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, Everett, why don't you talk to that one. I don't know how much in-depth I'd like to go on what our plans are for B2B at this point in time. I think we need to keep doing close to our chest, but feel free to elaborate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Yes, Shaan, I'll maybe -- I'll keep some close to the chest here, and you'll just have to see what happens in the next few months and quarters here. But overall, from a B2B manufacturing, I think you're talking about third party manufacturing. It's very little from an overall revenue standpoint. And I'd say, almost to kind of insignificant. Obviously, what I'd be careful of not mixing this up with is Green Roads brand sells through both B2B channels and B2C channels. So online BC, B2B goes through kind of those retail storefronts. But third party manufacturing, I think, is what you're asking. And I think this is one of the biggest synergies today, where they're really focused on, as Dale will tell you, their green roads, right? And that's what they want. And we have excess capacity now in that facility. Especially with Tyler's relationships and the relationships we've developed in Canada. I think this is one of the main synergies aspect from a B2B standpoint. And even I can say anecdotically, we've had some of the biggest kind of companies reach out on the back of the announcement saying, "Hey, we're also doing CBD in the U.S., and we're a customer of you guys are in Canada. Can we do something there? And the answer is yes. I think that this is just the start, and we'll obviously foster those conversations as they develop.

          Your next question comes from John Chu from Desjardins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chu,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          My first question, I guess, is on a revenue breakdown. Can you give us more details on just, I guess, sale by form factor or what's your best seller? And then as you look out going forward, how do you think that form factor breakdown is going to look market share wide in a mature market? So for example, in Canada, chocolates got off to a really good start, representing a good percentage of total sales for the industry. But the reality was the expectation with that gummies were going to represent the lion's share of that 2.0 out of both markets. I'm just trying to understand where you are with that and how you see that unfolding when the market matures?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Everett, why don't you take that one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I think that obviously, there's different categories in the kind of U.S. CBD space in general that are growing faster. I would say that I think that high level on third-party data, you see beverage is one of the fastest-growing as well as coming. I think that will be an obvious concentration for us to kind of give you some data on that. There are some other areas that are growing quickly. But John, maybe I'll leave those for a surprise kind of later on down the road as Dale and our Green Roads team we further integrate and launch those products in the market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chu,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then, I guess, I'm trying to -- you both seem to have formulations and some IP and there's some crossover products as well. So I'm wondering whether or not at some point going forward, if you find one of the formulations for one of the companies works better, would you look to change that formulation of what's already being produced using the other company's IP or formulation? Or would it be an add-on complementary and keeping that existing portfolio? I'm just trying to understand how you might integrate the 2 going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So Jeff, I'll let you tackle this one right after I kind of comment. The best way to think about our product portfolio going forward is fewer, bigger, better. So if there's a SKU naturally setting itself apart, we will push that 1 harder and drop of ones again. We don't have the egos on either side of the fence to whatever product sells. And if it makes money, it makes sense. So that's kind of the way we're seeing it. Jeff?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Yes. And I also think, John, about what consumer the various products are going after? So Green Roads from a Valens perspective and being our international health and wellness brand. Really, the product that's in there, any products that we have would fit into that category, as Tyler was saying, it's if there's a natural fit or natural crossover, eliminate the inefficiencies get one product that could meet that market and focus on that health and wellness sector from a brand perspective. But there's other market segments that we look at as well from our product offerings, whether that fits better into the recreational market, the lifestyle market, the medical market. So there's lots of opportunities for SES. We want to make sure that in each of those verticals, again as Tyler was saying, we've got the most efficient portfolio is available to our customers within each of those verticals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Chu,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Great. And if I could just squeeze one more in then. Just from a distribution perspective, are you in discussions with the Walgreens, Rite Aids or CVSs? Is that something you can talk about right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Everett, why don't you talk about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I would say that conversations with Dale and team, I think they're obviously ongoing. I think the main success, as you can have as a company is the B2C segment. But long-term with the FDA going and actually moving, I think that we will be there regardless. And I think you're just going to have to wait and see as those conversations progress. Maybe just even to expand on that today. It's important to note that mostly only topicals are in those segments. So when you look at the highest velocity sales from an item standpoint, it's really in the ingestibles, where we're seeing higher velocity in the independents, and that's the reason we're targeting those today. But it is a core focus. We will be there. And Dale and team are very sophisticated in that aspect from a distributor standpoint and especially with FDA guidance, I think that you're going to see moves there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Sarugaser,  Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD and Equity Analyst of Healthcare, Biotechnology & Cannabis    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the answer of the deal. So my first question really is sort of talking about synergies between Valens -- since you are two companies. So given that it's clearly a highly experienced team in the U.S. How are you guys looking at integration and synergies between the 2 companies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, Jeff, I'll probably pass this one to you. Rahul, appreciate it -- the time. There's a ton of synergies, not only in international business development, sales, marketing, brand portfolio, innovation, IP, the synergies are endless. So what we're basically going to do is throw everything on the table and see what makes the most sense to really double down on. And what we'll see is new products and new verticals to really start driving revenue that we're not capturing today. So Jeff, go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. And I think it's important to say right off the top that the Green Roads team, that comes with a full team and a full team that has capability far beyond the current product set and portfolio. So first and foremost, from a realizing return on this investment. From a balance perspective, we want them able to focus and generate that business plan that we both agreed as possible. Secondly, as we're going through, simply making introductions and broadening the distribution channel is a very, very easy way for us to start to really generate some synergy opportunity between the two companies. And then, as Tyler was saying, as the company continue to grow and we'll have, Rahul, as we should, the 100 day plan, where we're making sure that we're knocking off all the low-hanging fruit that we have plans in place to realize on these synergies over the coming months and quarters. But in an organized, well-structured way, that's not going to impede the growth and the opportunity that the Green Roads team currently has in front of them and is actually realizing on every day here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rahul Sarugaser,  Raymond James Ltd., Research Division - MD and Equity Analyst of Healthcare, Biotechnology & Cannabis    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Perfect. And then maybe a follow-up as a follow-up, and forgive me if I missed this in some of your filings, what is the revenue growth profile looks like on over the last couple of years? And without necessarily giving us specific guidance, how should we be thinking about an acceleration factor of that revenue growth going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Everett, why don't you take that one?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everett Knight,  The Valens Company Inc. - EVP of Corporate Development & Capital Markets    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So I would say that if you look at kind of 2019, Green Roads had a great year overall in the marketplace, Rahul, and like other CBD companies, what you saw with these -- especially as mom-and-pop stores, kind of shut down from that perspective. We saw kind of a pullback in the overall revenue profile. But as Dale will tell you, we're seeing that naturally kind of open back up. So I think you're going to see growth, obviously, in kind of the 2021 from those 2020 with as COVID restrictions abate, I think you're going to see significant growth in kind of that 2022 area as you can get up to even that past that 2019 level. And Dale, I don't know if there's any more commentary you want to add to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [48]

          No, Everett. I think you covered it pretty well. I think the U.S. is just that just in the last few months, I think, starting to shake off COVID a little bit, and we expect to see the recovery go. And when we run our business plan, we forecast by the end of this year that would be about 85% reduced. So I think we're tracking. We see the growth, and we see people talking about new initiatives, new products and new opportunities. So I think Everett's forecast is good.

          Your next question comes from Pablo Zuanic from Cantor Fitzgerald.

Pablo Ernesto Zuanic,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst    [50]

          Congratulations to all parties involved. Dale, can I ask just two very quick questions. One, if I look at CBDMD, it trades about 4x sales, Charlotte wave, I think it's close to 6x now. Obviously, the way you have described the company during this presentation, it sounds like you're very attractive proposition. Why not have pursued an IPO route? I mean, you sold the company at 1.8x sales, I mean, based on what you disclosed, can you comment on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I can. In fact, I think Tyler and the other folks know, we chose Valens for a lot of reasons that didn't have to do with the dollar amount on a day of closing. We had offers, quite frankly, in here to invest in us or purchase from us at higher numbers. We thought that the combination of 3 things. One was with them sitting here on the phone, we like the Valens team, okay? We made a lot of management teams out there. We're highly competitive and driven ourselves, and we were not impressed by a lot of the other suitors we saw. And across the board, when I had pulled my whole team, everybody chose to go with balance, even though the financial offer, at least initially, was less you'll note that we're taking most of the compensation of the transaction in stock. Okay? 
And the reason for us, and I hope I don't blow all your analysts' predictions. We think the stock is going up. And we think that what we got in return is going to go up two, 2, 3, 4 fold. So we're happy to join the Valens team. We think we can make a difference to them. They're not a $3 billion company. We go through and add $50 million, $60 million, $75 million of sales and hit our EBITDA numbers, we think we make a difference in the value. So let me throw on -- that's it. Our founders were very focused on the quality of our product. And what we do and how we represent ourselves in the marketplace. And when we met Tyler and we met Jeff and we talked with Everett, the focus in terms of the value systems and the cultures of the company just fit. So if you look at putting our 2 companies together, and quite honestly, how smart and how accomplished the Valens guys are, how disciplined they've been in terms of what they've done. It was just such a good fit between us that we took an inferior financial offer at least upfront because we believe that longer term, it's going to be the best return for our shareholders.

Pablo Ernesto Zuanic,  Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Research Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Understood. That's very helpful. And just one quick follow-up, and I'm sorry if this came up already, but did you talk about your channel mix right now? Like how much is online, how much brick-and-mortar and within brick-and-mortar, FEM versus specialty, can you talk about that just very briefly?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Baker,   -     [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Just -- I think we've touched on it before. Right now, we're about 50-50 between online and brick-and-mortar. We think we're going to go to about 60% or 65% online, that's sort of our goal. And within the FDMC and the historical mom-and-pops, we are at the moment from a sales volume standpoint, heavier on the independent, independent pharmacies and the independent lifestyle stores. Yes. 
The one thing we haven't touched on with you guys is international. And we think international, which for Green Roads, has been very small to date. We think a number of new opportunities there. But clearly, the Valens team is way ahead of us in terms of international presence and international knowledge. We intend to rely on them and ride their coattails to some degree in terms of introductions into those marketplaces. So that was another key reason for us was, quite honestly, they were smart and experienced in areas that we were not.

          We have a follow-up question from Andrew Partheniou from Stifel GMP.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Partheniou,  Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc., Research Division - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Follow-up question here. I just wanted to touch on the input side. How do you see supply of hemp-derived CBD right now after what happened in the last 2 years? And what do you think it's going to look like going forward? And how do you think that's going to impact Green Roads?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Maybe I'll talk this one and Dale, you can happily to jump on. With what I've done in the past, I've already secured cheaper biomass that meets all specifications and microbials. Best aside that we need. So our margin is going to get better immediately. And I'm not concerned whatsoever, both securing supply long term. One thing we can do is do contract growth, so we can grow a specific genetic for a specific reason for a specific consumer experience. And again, that really goes to the model of what we're trying to build is putting the consumer first. So I have absolutely zero concerns about securing biomass going forward and significantly cheaper than what the Green Roads team is buying it at historically.

          Next question comes from Scott Fortune from ROTH Capital Partners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Thomas Fortune,  ROTH Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - Director & Research Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I know it's been a long one. But real quick, timing on this you guys thought around the FDA? And any update from that? And then kind of looking at broad spectrum, full spectrum or kind of CBD isolate, from a product offering around FDA or any legalization side of things?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Jeff, why don't you talk to the first one, then I can handle the second.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So while there's currently conversations ongoing and the FDA is working through their process. As a firm, we don't think the strategy that we would follow or that we have followed here would be overly dependent on the timing of that. We believe as long as we focus on quality, consistency, standard operating procedures, testing, making sure that we're delivering a pure and a consistent product to the market, that best positions us for whatever comes down the change from the FDA perspective. So we think that's a much better risk-adjusted approach to the market than having a business plan that's focused on specifics around when the FDA actually does come to the market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I don't think I could have said that better myself. So I'll probably leave it at that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          There are no further questions. I'll now turn it back to Tyler for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Perfect. Jeff, if you could just comment quickly on the NASDAQ listing. I know there's a few outstanding questions that we never had a chance to go to before my closing remarks?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Fallows,  The Valens Company Inc. - President    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Happy to. So as probably everybody on the phone here is seen today, we're very excited to announce that we submitted an application to list on NASDAQ. The timing of that announcement was not luck. We wanted to have a North American strategy, a North American platform in place. And with that in place, it made sense for us to move to an offering for shareholders and investors on a North American base. So the strategy to launch on NASDAQ was designed to make sure that those who see the products and know the products in and have it in everyday lives, have access to that on whatever platform that they want to have access to it on. That's our strategy. 
Clearly, as we go to make that listing, there's requirements around share price and things that may be required to ensure that we qualify for that listing. And speaking specifically about potentially a share consolidation, a minor share consolidation may be required, but it is not necessarily so. Depending on how our share price goes and the requirements that sort of requirements from the NASDAQ perspective. It's not required, and we have a very, very keen focus on ensuring the liquidity that we worked so hard as a company to increase and the primary objective, as I said, on going to NASDAQ is increasing that liquidity to us shareholders. That we're not going to mess with that liquidity and that we will only be doing a consolidation to the point that is required to meet NASDAQ listing requirements and ensure that there's still tremendous upside in our shares from an industrial perspective.

Andrew Tyler Robson,  The Valens Company Inc. - CEO & Chairman    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Perfect. Appreciate it, Jeff. Well, I appreciate everybody taking the time. We're extremely excited about this opportunity to, yes, bring it to a close and get to work. So expect more -- this is the first step in our U.S. strategy, expect vertical integration, new products, new revenue, new capabilities. And there's more to come. I said it a while ago, and we're sticking to it, fewer, bigger, better. We're excited, and I think we're going to show you guys watch. So appreciate you taking the time and stay safe. With that, I'll ask the operator to close the call.
