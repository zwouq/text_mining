--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss today's announcement. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to turn the call over to Raphael Gross of ICR to begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raphael Gross,  ICR, LLC - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actual results could differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tilray Brands' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Irwin Simon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much, Rafe, and I know everybody has seen our press release that was released at 4:05 today. I am joined today by our CFO, Carl Merton; our Head of International Business and Chief Strategy Officer, Denise Faltischek; and President of our U.S. beer business, Ty Gilmore.
We appreciate you joining us for the brief call to discuss this very exciting and transformational transaction that will fuel Tilray Brands' future in the U.S. craft beer industry and reflects the ongoing strides we're making in diversifying our overall business.
Recall the other week when we announced 2023 fiscal year results, I mentioned that when I first joined Aphria team in 2018, Aphria was exclusively a Canadian cannabis LP with approximately $50 million in annual revenue and minimal cash. Now Tilray Brands, we've come a long way over the last 5 years. Having reached close to that $1 billion of revenue across 4 distinct complementary business segments while holding still nearly $500 million in cash, and with this makes us EBITDA positive with this acquisition.
As we just announced this afternoon, we'll be acquiring 8 craft beer and beverage brands from Anheuser-Busch, ABI, their high-end division. The transaction include breweries, brewpubs associated with these business and is expected to be completed later this year, subject to customary closing conditions. The purchase price will be paid in cash.
Having already built the portfolio of best-in-class brands across the medical cannabis, adult-use cannabis, beverage alcohol, wellness and distribution, this acquisition is indicative of our success building a diversified CPG growth strategy as we approach that $1 billion in revenue with diversification and balance across our cannabis lifestyle and our CPG brands.
Pro forma revenue of approximately $860 million is comprised of approximately 30% cannabis consisting of medical and adult use and inclusive of our recent HEXO acquisition, approximately 30% from our beverage alcohol and approximately 30% from medical distribution and approximately 10% from our food and wellness products.
More specifically, we expect today's acquisition triples the size of our already fast-growing beverage alcohol segment from 4 million cases to 12 million cases annually positioning us the fifth largest craft brewer in the U.S., with a 5% craft beer market share. From a cold start, just under 3 years ago, we acquired SweetWater, and this is a rapid one that we have delivered value every step of the way, and we're poised to continue to do so.
The proof point here is that upon closing the transaction, pro forma revenue is expected to reach $300 million annually for our fast-growing profitable u.S. alcohol portfolio brands. To raise beer geographical presence will be truly nation-wise.
As a pro forma basis, we expect to be the #1 craft beer company in Pacific Northwest, the #5 craft beer company in the Northeast, the #4 craft beer company in the Southeast and the #4 craft beer company in the Midwest. And beyond our presence in these markets, we see particularly exciting opportunities for all these brands in the Great Lakes and Texas.
This is an exciting milestone for our beverage portfolio. No question. But I also want to emphasize that cannabis remains central to our overall strategy. We remain excited by the opportunities we have in the cannabis industry as the market leader in Canada, the largest federal legal cannabis market in the world, where we have an approximately 30% market share.
And are the medical cannabis leader across Europe through our medical cannabis market share position in Germany, Poland and Luxembourg. We also have a leader in the hemp food industry with a 51% branded market share with Manitoba Harvest.
I will briefly describe the individual brands in a moment, but let me first say that they each possess key differentiation hallmarks, strong consumer loyalty, authentic and compelling original stories, consistency and quality to further have a history of delivering award-winning products and tremendous, tremendous growth opportunities.
They will adjoin our existing beverage alcohol portfolio, which consists of SweetWater Brewing Company, Montauk Brewing Company, Alpine Beer Company and Green Flash Brewing Company. We also own the Breckenridge Distillery, the award-winning brand and World's Best blended whiskey and Happy Flower CBD sparkling non-alcohol cocktails.
We see the following considerations as strategic rationale for this acquisition. It greatly accelerates and strengthens Tilray's leadership in craft brewery. These highly regarded craft brands solidify our market share nationwide and all have potential for upside growth across all our major channels stemming from extended capabilities in beverage alcohol and nonalcoholic offerings.
It expands distribution nationally. It provides us with modern facilities and operations. This acquisition includes 4 production facilities across the U.S., which are all up to date with the state-of-art equipment. This brings our business to 6 production facilities.
There are also 8 brewpub locations, which all have beautiful, compelling, authentic that are popular destinations for their customers. This brings our total number of brewpubs to 12. It also provides us additional manufacturing capacity and innovation capabilities for commercial expansion opportunities with beverage alcohol.
And last but not least, it generates EBITDA and synergies and of course, additional synergies that are being identified to increase profitability and these brands are immediately EBITDA positive to our overall business.
As we look ahead, our big bets will be driven by consumer and data insights that span innovation, taproom activation, trial and sampling, operational efficiencies, convenience and channels that have white space opportunities in natural and regional strongholds across categories and greater focus on e-commerce.
Now let me briefly describe each of these iconic brands. Shock Top is an award-winning traditional Belgium-style wheat ale that is flavorable, refreshing. It has high consumer awareness and strong on-premise. Shock Top also has seasonal lineup led by Twisted Pretzel, which delivers the delicious taste of the bakery-fresh pretzels.
Blue Point Brewing holds regional relevance in the Northeast as one of the largest breweries in New York State. The brand brews a lineup of easy-drinking and innovative craft beer and has won numerous awards from the World Beer Cup, the Great American Beer Festival and the New York Craft Beer Competition among others.
Breckenridge Brewery is one of the leading craft brands in Colorado and has grown into one of the most recognized craft breweries in the U.S.. It has 2 locations, the original Breckenridge location and the Farm House location in Littleton.
10 Barrel Brewing is one of the most acclaimed breweries in the U.S. boasting award-winning team of brewers and 4 brewpub location. The brand has built a loyal following in the Pacific Northwest and is known for its outdoor adventure and vibe.
Redhook Brewery is one of the original craft breweries brewing great beers for more than 4 decades and is a recipient of many awards. In 2017, they opened up Redhook Brewlab in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood with an 8-barrel brewing system, which consumers can taste the latest experiments. Earlier this year, it was launched -- it launched the Big Ballard IPA Variety Pack, the industry's first Imperial Craft 18 pack.
Widmer Brothers Brewing is one of the largest craft brewers in the Pacific Northwest. It has won numerous awards over the years, including gold in the 2023 Best Craft Beer Awards and Largest Brewery of the Year.
Square Mile Cider Company offers ciders made with pure Pacific Northwest apples and lager yeast to create perfectly crisp and semi-dry hard ciders.
And lastly, HiBall produces a clean energy seltzer made with zero sugar, zero calories and organic caffeine. These nonalcoholic beverages are crafted with a proprietary organic-certified energy brand.
What a great group of brands. Underlying the potential of these brands is an important fact that Tilray's leadership team brings deep CPG experience and stellar acquisition integration track records to drive revenue, cost synergies with these acquisitions while expanding distribution significantly to market across the U.S. and international.
It is incredible to think about this. But just in 3 years, we have solidified our leadership in craft beer industry, and one that, as we have said in the past, is cool and getting cooler. Our focus is on maximizing the potential of these brands, which already have strong and committed following.
And of course, when federal cannabis legalization occurs, it will be able to include THC-based products in our beverage and wellness portfolio as well. We are excited to be partnering with ABI on this mutually-benefit transaction.
ABI has set these brands up extremely well with talented teams, significant investments over the years. They are positioned for a bright future, and we look forward to taking them all the way to the next level as we fuel the future success of the craft beer industry.
We thank you for your time today. As we are excited about this deal on such relatively short notice, we now would like -- be happy to open up the lines for questions. Operator?


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with TD Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivien Nicole Azer,  TD Cowen, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the transaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Vivien.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivien Nicole Azer,  TD Cowen, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding that you guys aren't disclosing the terms of the transaction, is there anything kind of dimensionally that you can offer either on valuation or on EBITDA margins for the business that you just acquired?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. So Vivien, we have -- there's an 8-K filed today with that, but price is not -- but again, listen, I think we identified these brands. We contacted ABI and see would they be interested in some transaction. We have lots of discussions with them. We worked with them. And that's how this came about.
But I think it's one of the big things as we strategically looked on how to map together a national craft beer business and which brands out there were complementary to SweetWater, Montauk, Green Flash, Alpine and Nelson is we came up with these brands. And I got to tell you, synergistically from a production standpoint with Blue Point, with 10 Barrel makes a lot of sense for us.
And now as we look at it from a national standpoint, in each part of the country and some of the open territories and states like Texas, in Louisiana, areas that we can go, we really can build out a major footprint. And you've heard me say before, as I've talked about the cannabis category, I think the beer category -- the craft beer category has tremendous opportunity. And I think there's a lot of new products.
There's a lot of activation. There's a lot of new consumers coming in here. And with that, with adding these brands. And along with this comes 8 brewhouses, which now gives us 12. And you heard me say in my remarks about the activation and what we can do with these are tremendous for Tilray.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivien Nicole Azer,  TD Cowen, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if I could just squeeze in a follow-up real quick. Understanding that these brands have a pretty significant owned footprint through taprooms and through other on-premise channels. Can you just talk about revenue trends for the portfolio of assets that you acquired? Because all we can see is Nielsen data. And the collective brand portfolio has seen revenue declines for 3 consecutive years. So any -- just commentary on total revenue trends, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listen, I think as we come back with COVID, with on-premise, off-premise and being part of a bigger portfolio, there are some brands that grow and some don't. And I think with that, the way we looked at it is what -- it's not what the brands we're doing before, it's what we can do with them going forward.
And I think that's the big thing here is, and that's why we approached ABI is looking at brands and what we could do with them as they complement our current brands. And I think that is the key here.
Together, what Montauk and Blue Point can do in the Northeast, what it could do from production facilities, okay? What we could do in Texas with some of this. Shock Top, which I think is just one of the greatest beer. Was advertised on the Super Bowl, not too long ago. And I think it's one of the greatest Belgium white beers out there. So I think that's how we looked at it is what we can do in growing these and what it can do in regards to our current craft beer businesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of John Zamparo with CIBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Zamparo,  CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Associate    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just want to get a bit more detail on the strategic merits of this deal, and you're buying it from a pretty sophisticated player. Presumably, you're not just buying it to become a larger company within the craft brew space. So just want to get a better idea of the financial benefits of combining these brands with your existing portfolio.
If you could quantify synergies or just give some color on where those are coming from. Specifically, how long do you think it will take to get those synergies? Any more details on that would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So as I said in my remarks, scale is important. Scale is important with distributorship. Scale is important with customer base. Scales and report in regards to procurement out there today. And with that, that brings every bit of that to our current beer business.
You heard me say we go from 4 million cases to 12 million cases. We've come from the 9th largest craft brewer to the 4th or 5th largest craft brewer out there.
So number one, there's scale. Number two, it gets us into different markets from a regional standpoint. And as I've said, is this here. I come back and look at the opportunities in the craft beer business is tremendous. And this fills out geographically areas that we would not have been able to go with our current businesses.
Ultimately, upon legalization one day, is there the opportunity for adjacencies in the THC and CBD world and having that distribution system, having those manufacturing facilities. And again, we're not dependent upon it. But there's a lot of great companies that have been built around the beer category.
And I think as the generations, whether it's Gen Z, baby boomers, beer is something everybody seems to want to come back and drink sometime in their lifetime and be a part of an occasion and we see a big opportunity with it. So -- and in regards to the synergies, we think there'll be, as I said, it's accretive to EBITDA. There will be synergies that we'll derive from this as we put this together. And there has to be, if you go from 4 million cases to 12 million.
Along with the brewpubs, great sampling opportunities, great activation with customers, and you just think about those markets we're not in today, bringing Montauk in the Pacific Northwest. Bringing some of the Pacific Northwest 10 Barrel back to the East Coast.
Today, if you go to Yankee Stadium, you'll get Blue Point. You go to Citi Field, you will get Montauk. So there's so many complementary areas of these. And that's why we specifically, as we approached ABI, why we focused on these brands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Zamparo,  CIBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Associate    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Understood. Is it fair to assume the profitability of these brands is a bit below your current beverage alcohol portfolio? And what holds you back from lifting guidance on this? Is it more a function of timing? Or is it that you think it will take maybe a year to get the profitability where you want it to be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's a couple of things. It's timing number one. Number two, it's timing you get the deal closed, which hopefully is in 60 to 90 days and really to go in and get a good understanding before we do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Carter with Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Andrew Carter,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - VP    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apologies, I joined late, if I asked this, but I guess after you kind of consummate this deal, do we have the bandwidth both from a financial standpoint and kind of operationally to kind of continue this strategy? And I think could this proceed like kind of using this platform to more aggressively go after beer brands? And how do you think about kind of other categories? You've got Manitoba food? Are they off the table? Or are you just getting narrowly focused on beverages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew, I worry -- I think, listen, I come back and I've said this before and I said on our earnings call, as we look at our cannabis business in Canada where we've grown to the #1 share with 13% of the market there, integrating HEXO and see tremendous opportunities.
In regards to our beverage business, in a short period of time with SweetWater and Montauk and Green Flash, we've become the #5 craft brewer in the U.S. In Europe, we have a strong medical -- the medical distribution business. And yes, we have Manitoba Harvest, which has a 51% share.
So we have a great platform. And think about where we came from 2018 to 2019 and approaching that $1 billion. So nothing's off the table here, but we have 4 distinct categories of businesses that we're in today and 4 really good foundations and bases that are EBITDA positive, that contribute to the overall infrastructure, gives us lots of optionality out there.
We're not dependent upon legalization of cannabis where we are. We have great market share where we are. We have great brands. And like I'm a big believer in being a national business. I'm a big believer in being a global business. There's opportunities with these brands in Canada. There's international brands.
So nothing is off the table for us. But I think what the important thing is this strengthens and gives us a good foundation in each of the categories that we're focused on. And you heard what I said before, now we got a 30% of adult use in medical cannabis business. We have a 30% share of our business today is in the beverage alcohol. 30% is in the medical distribution in our European business. And then we absolutely do have Manitoba Harvest, which absolutely, there's opportunities in the whole wellness space for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irwin David Simon,  Tilray Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Chairman    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much, operator, and thank you very much for joining us on this short notice today. Exciting news and exciting time for Tilray Brands. And I think that's important is we became Tilray Brands over a year ago, we have 12 great brands in our cannabis industry today joining our brands in our beverage alcohol. We'll have close to 22 brands there. We have our Tilray Medical brands in Europe. We have our Manitoba Harvest. So we have an incredible stable of brands built within Tilray Brands.
And with that, again, we have many levers to pull, and we're very focused and diversified. But with a lot of adjacencies as we all bring it together. It is past 4:20, so I can't tell you to go have a 4:20, but go out there, enjoy one of our great beers, whether it's SweetWater, whether it's Montauk, Green Flash, Alpine, Nelson. And now you can go and have a Blue Point, 10 Barrel and some of the other -- Shock Top. There's some great, great products out there.
I want to thank the management team that worked on this here. I want to thank the ABI team members that with us on there. Just a first-class team that we worked with here. And we're excited over the next 60, 90 days to get this done.
Enjoy the rest of your summer. Enjoy plenty of beer. Drive carefully and look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you.
