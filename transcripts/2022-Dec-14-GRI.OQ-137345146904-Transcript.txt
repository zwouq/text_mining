David Baker, Vallon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  - President & CEO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, [Jenny]. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. As announced earlier today, Vallon has entered into a definitive all-stock merger agreement with privately held GRI Bio and its shareholders.
I'm excited to discuss the proposed transaction to strategically combine Vallon Pharmaceuticals and GRI Bio, and I'm honored to be joined on this call by Marc Hertz, a well established biopharmaceutical executive and the CEO of GRI Bio, who will become the CEO of the combined company upon the anticipated closing of the merger transaction.
Earlier this year, Vallon Pharmaceuticals', Board of Directors hired Ladenburg Thalmann as an advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives and engage in broad-based marketing average. Our objective was to create a strategic combination that would yield a stronger company while increasing shareholder value. In our view, this broad-based effort has proven to be successful with the execution of the merger agreement for the proposed transaction with GRI Bio.
GRI Bio is a clinical-stage biotech company focused on fundamentally changing the way inflammatory disease is treated. We're excited to present this opportunity to balance shareholders as this proposed transaction will yield a new company with a pipeline of NKT cell regulators for the treatment of high-value inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases with access to sufficient capital resources to fund operations into mid 2024 through multiple significant milestones.
GRI is led by an experienced management team with deep scientific and clinical  expertise in immunology. Here, you can see the general terms of the proposed transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement,  Vallon will acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interest of GRI Bio by means of a reverse triangular merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vallon with and into GRI Bio, with GRI Bio surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vallon.
In connection with the closing of the merger, Vallon is expected to change its name to GRI Bio Inc. Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Altium Capital, a New York-based institutional healthcare investor has entered into a securities purchase agreement to invest $14.75 million and committed to an additional $10 million in future investments in the combined company, subject to the terms and conditions described therein.
Immediately following the closing of the merger and the financing, the equity holders of GRI Bio are expected to own approximately 83% of the outstanding equity of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. And the equity holders of Vallon are expected to own approximately 17% of the outstanding equity of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. These final ownership stakes are subject to adjustment as necessary to meet requirements for listing on NASDAQ and the issuance of warrants on the 11th trading day following the merger.
The combined company will have a Board of Directors consisting of five members, four to be designated by GRI and one designated by Vallon. I'm pleased to say that I will be joining the Board as the Vallon designate.
Following the closing of the merger, the combined company is expected to operate under the name GRI Bio Inc. We'll focus on the development of GRI Bio's pipeline and trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol GRI. The proposed merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.
I will now turn the presentation over to Marc Hertz, Chief Executive Officer of GRI Bio, along with his team, who'll provide you description of the differentiated technology platform and compelling pipeline of his company. Mark over to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, everyone. We are very excited to have entered into this merger agreement with Vallon. This transaction has the potential to be transformational and provide the opportunity of value creation for both Vallon and GRI. I'd like to thank David and the entire Vallon team for their collaboration and getting to this point.
Now I'll turn to the GRI opportunity. We are advancing an innovative pipeline of NKT cell modulators for the treatment of inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune disease. We're initially targeting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, two diseases desperately in need of solutions. Also, upon closing of this merger, we will have access to sufficient capital to realize multiple key milestones into mid 2024.
Before we dive further into the story, I'd like to introduce the GRI Bio management team. I'll go first. I am Marc Hertz, CEO and Co-Founder of GRI Bio. I am trained as an immunologist, and I've been working in biotech approaching 25 years, taking therapeutics from concept through Phase 3, including 25 R&D programs, 10 I&Ds, five Phase 2s, and two Phase 3s.
I've been fortunate to work within and we have many different functional areas of biotech, including R&D, business development, fundraising and Investor Relations. And most recently prior to GRI, I was CEO of the US subsidiary of Pharmexa, an immunotherapy company public in Europe. Vipin.

Marc Hertz, GRI Bio, Inc.     - CEO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To round out the team, we will appoint a CFO in connection with the merger and will make this announcement as we get closer to finalizing the merger.
I would now like to discuss our development pipeline for establishing a deep and focused pipeline, leveraging our innovative and proprietary programs addressing high-value indications as well as areas where there remains significant therapeutic shortcomings. We are in the process of launching a Phase 2a biomarker study for our lead program, GRI-0621, which if successful, the results will support our Phase 2b study, a potentially pivotal study.
Our second lead program, GRI-0803 is initially being developed for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease that has seen limited innovation in the past 50 years. Furthermore, we have additional mid-stage clinical programs ready for development with additional funding or partnerships and a robust pipeline of over 500 proprietary compounds that provide the company many options for organic growth to fuel our development pipeline for years to come.
A novel immune mechanism that is seeing a lot of potential in oncology also has important applications in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. GRI Bio's programs target the activity of Natural Killer T cells or NKT cells to regulate the adaptive and innate immune access to reset dysfunctional immune responses.
So what does that mean? Our body has two main arms of the immune system: the adaptive arm shown on the right and the innate arm shown on the left. While the two systems are independent, they don't necessarily act independently of each other all the time. There is significant cross talk between the systems. In fact, many chronic conditions are initiated by a dysregulation of the adaptive arm of the immune system, would over time are propagated by the innate immune system.
Here, I have discovered that NKT cells are critical regulators of both arms of the immune system and potentially mediate the cross talk between the adaptive and innate system. NKT cells are indeed like adaptive T-cells. They're technically part of the adaptive immune system, but they behave more like innate cells. And they highly influence the activity of other immune cells of both arms of the immune system.
Type I or NKT I cells are pro-inflammatory effector T cells. Type II or NKT II cells are anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. GRI is developing both inhibitors of NKT I cells and agonist of NKT II cells. And we believe that regulating the activity of NKT cells is a more selective approach to immunomodulation, allowing for the specific modulation of the activity of a critical lymphocyte sitting at the apex of the inflammatory cascade rather than systemically inhibiting any one molecule throughout the whole body.
We believe there is significant competitive advantage in targeting NKT cells versus other approaches for immune resolution and resetting of homeostasis. In model after model from pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, autoimmunity and metabolic disease  NKT I cells are critical for the induction of disease and development of fibrosis. This can be shown with genetic knockouts of NKT I cells or with our inhibitors of NKT I cell activity in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings.
And what we've been able to show, highlighted in the panel on the right is that NKT I cells sit at the apex of the inflammatory cascade upstream of many of the key targets in the fibrogenesis pathway. Thus by targeting NKT I cells, we have the potential of impacting many downstream targets, while other programs in development often are hitting a single target.
I will now have our Chief Medical Officer, Albert Agro walk us through our lead program, GRI-0621.

Thank you, Mark. I'll discuss our lead program, GRI-0621 for the treatment of IPF, an orphan indication that has approximately 40,000 newly diagnosed cases annually. We have planned a launching, a Phase 2a biomarker study in the first half of 2023, the data expected mid 2024. This biomarker study, we plan on [listing] has been designed in part by our Scientific Advisory Board to drill down into the mechanisms involved in IPF with an emphasis on further characterizing the role of NKT cells in driving the pathology.
Additionally, this program is leveraging a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which has been agreed to with the FDA. IPF is a rare chronic progressive pulmonary disease, causing abnormal scarring, resulting in significant lung damage and death. The derailed immune system drives them towards fibrosis.
On the right side of this slide, you can see the patient's journey through a diagnosis of IPF. The age of onset is in the mid 60s. Median survival is two to three years after. Almost 80% of patients die within five years of their IPF diagnosis. Lung transplant is the only measure that at present can improve this.
There are only two drugs presently approved for the management of IPF. Unfortunately, both have significant side effects, no meaningful impact on overall survival. Despite that global sales of these two agents topped 4 billion combined.
Quite clearly, patients and clinicians are in need of an effective and safe alternative. That brings us to our lead asset GRI-0621, which we truly believe will make a difference in the management of IPF. GRI-0621 is an oral formulation FDA-approved topical drug, tazarotene, a selective RAR-β and  RAR-ɣ agonists. The GRI has shown to be a potent inhibitor of NKT I cell activity.
Tazarotene is well established as a topical therapy. While the oral formulation has never been approved, it does have a well-established safety profile from earlier studies in patients with psoriasis, where about 1,700 patients have been exposed for up to a year of therapy. These results, coupled with our experimental data showing effect on fibrosis, form a strong foundation for the Phase 2a biomarker study.
So lets look at the role of NKT I cells on driving the progression of IPF. The left-hand panel demonstrates that there is an increase in activity of NKT I cells. This is associated with disease severity in the IPF-patient population.
The right-hand panel shows data from a bleomycin induced IPF model, where both NKT I cell knockout animals. and animals treated with NKT I inhibitors have reductions in hydroxyproline and collagen deposition to levels comparable to vehicle-treated animals. We believe that NKT I cells can be an important biomarker of IPF as well as an important pharmacodynamic parameter to study in disease.
The role of TGF-β in IPF as well as other fibrotic conditions is now well established. On the right-hand panel of this slide, we have shown that NKT I cell in addition, either by knockout or with our inhibitor, reduces the level of  TGF-β. We can confirm that reducing TGF-β results in the decrease of other profibrotic inflammatory macrophage populations, stop fibrosis and improves overall survival.
This slide takes a closer look at the Phase 2 biomarker study planned to initiate in the first half of 2023. The design is presently planned to be a four-arm, six-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in patients not receiving background therapy for IPF. We will examine three doses of GRI-0621 compared to placebo in approximately 35 patients where the primary endpoint will be safety and NKT I cell activation in both BAL and blood.
We'll take the opportunity to look at some exploratory endpoints, including collagen degradation, macrophage population and various other inflammatory markers in blood and BAL. If the study is successful, we believe it has the potential to support a potential pivotal Phase 2b study.
As we look at some of our select peers in the past few years, it is clear that they have been part of some significant acquisitions. Many of them occurring at current stage or earlier. Clearly a playbook has been established, and we believe this creates significant optionality for GRI. This level of activity reflects the high unmet need in this indication.
GRIs approach truly has the potential to address the underlying drivers of IPF rather than simply a symptom of the disease. In other words, you can trying to reduce the levels of TGF-β in fibrotic disease or you can address the immune mechanisms leading to increased production of TGF-β. And this approach is what separates GRI from others.
I now have the good fortune of turning this over to Vipin Kumar, our Chief Scientific Officer to talk through our developmental program for GRI-0803. Vipin.

Thank you, Albert. I would now like to focus on GRI-0803, an NKT activator, for the treatment of SLE, which we anticipate filing the IND in fourth quarter of 2023. SLE is an autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of childbearing age. It affects approximately 160,000 people in the US and current treatment options are limited, primarily immunosuppressive therapies, which have many concerns.
This is really a space in need of innovation. Only two drugs have been approved for SLE in the past 50 years. oral administration of NKT II agonist leads to inhibition of tissue inflammation, autoantibody production, collagen deposition and renal fibrosis in a spontaneous model of lupus nephritis. This is accompanied with the improved glomerular pathology, proteinuria and overall survival of animals from lupus nephritis, a most common form of lupus.
We are rapidly advancing NKT II agonist GRI-0803 toward an IND filing, which we expect in the fourth quarter of 2023, and data expected in the first half of 2024. The steps between now and the IND are relatively straightforward in our standard in preclinical development.
We are really advancing innovative NKT-centered platform with significant opportunities beyond IPF and SLE. To name a few, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis alone represent major indications where we believe NKT-targeted approach has the potential to benefit.
And with that, I would now like to turn back to Marc to discuss the potential milestone opportunities ahead for GRI. Marc

Thank you, Vipin. We have set the stage for what we believe to be potentially value-driving milestones. To start, we expect to close the merger with Vallon in the first quarter of 2023, which we believe has the potential to benefit all key stakeholders.
We're preparing to launch our Phase 2a study of GRI-0621 next quarter, and expect data which could support a potentially pivotal study in the second quarter of 2024, just over a year later. We are also rapidly advancing GRI-0803 towards an IND with a Phase 1a and Phase 1b study starting shortly thereafter.
I would also like to note that we are continually evaluating opportunities to expand our pipeline and leverage our more than 500 proprietary compounds to provide the company many options for organic growth to fuel our development for years to come.
In summary, we believe GRI represents an opportunity for significant value creation and the opportunity to provide important solutions for patients and physicians. We are very excited about the future for GRI, and truly believe this merger will be transformational for both companies.
We have a leading technology to modulate the activity of NKT cells. In the near term, we are targeting two high value indications, both in need of real innovation. The critical role NKT cells play in disease and the breadth of our robust pipelines provide the GRI the opportunity to rapidly grow into an important company providing innovative treatment options for patients. We have a proven team with extensive experience in NKT cell biology, immunology and drug development.
Thank you.
