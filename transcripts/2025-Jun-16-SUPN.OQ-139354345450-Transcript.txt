--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call to discuss the exciting transaction we announced earlier today.
Throughout the presentation we will be referring to slides that have been provided through the webcast for this goal.
Starting on slide 4 of the presentation, I would like to provide an overview of the transaction with the timing for closing and integration.
Regarding the purchase price, the offer price is $8.50 per share in cash at closing.
Plus $3.50 per share, payable according to specific milestones and contingent value rights.
$1 per share is the US net sales as reported by Supernas, which is 50% of the net revenue reported by SAA's partner Baja, reached $250 million or more by year end 2027.
Another $1 per share if Zube's US net sales reach $300 million or more by year end 2028.
Another $1 per share if Zube's US net sales reached $375 million or more by year end 2030.
An additional $0.50 per share at commercialization in Japan by Sage's partner Shinogi by June 30, 2026.
The equity value of the offer is 561 million at closing.
And the total potential value of the offer is up to approximately $795 million or $12 per share.
Other considerations regarding the transaction.
The transaction clearly provides immediate diversification of revenue and acceleration of the top line growth for superness.
It is also expected to be significantly accretive to adjusted operating income on a non-gap basis, operating income in EPS in 2026.
This transaction represents a strong fit with the existing infrastructure and is expected to yield up to $200 million in potential synergies on an annualized basis.
And the financing of the transaction will be through cash on the balance sheet.
As far as the timing of the transaction, it is expected to close in the 3rd quarter of 2025, and we will be working very closely with our colleagues at Sage on the transition and integration planning to ensure continued success.
The Sage commercial infrastructure plays a key role in sustaining the launch momentum of their zoove and expanding the reach to additional prescribers.
The next slide 5, looking at the strategic rationale and what this transaction provides supernas.
First, it strengthens our leading psychiatry portfolio. Currently, Supernas has strong presence in psychiatry with Calvary in ADHD and also is developing SPNA20 in the depression space.
This transaction adds an innovative commercial product to our psychiatry portfolio. With the Zuve in postpartum depression.
The will be a new growth catalyst in our portfolio given the strong launch and continued momentum that it has experienced so far, and it will expand our reach into new channels through the OBGYN physician target audience that could represent in the future growth opportunities from a business development perspective.
Third, the transaction diversifies and increases our revenue base and cash flow.
And it will provide us with a new long term growth driver.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect the transaction to be significantly accretive to 2026, adjusting operating income, and earnings per share.
The transaction also provides synergies because of the overlap with existing infrastructure.
Meaningful synergies are expected to be up to 200 million on an annualized basis, and Supernas is very well positioned to execute alongside Sage's partner, Main.
And finally, the transaction also strengthens our internal R&D discovery capabilities by augmenting our discovery platforms and expertise.
With that, I will now turn over the call to Brian to walk you through the Zuve and the commercial opportunity in postpartum depression.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Roecklein,     [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jack. That's slide 6.
I'm going to give a brief top line on the product for Zuve, postpartum depression, a little epidemiology information, and then discuss the brand performance to date.
On slide 6, it's indicated here that Suzuve is the first and only oral treatment specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with PPD that would essentially be women.
There's two clinical studies that showed a rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms versus placebo. Over a 14-day course of treatment was seen as early as day 3 and maintained at day 45.
In those two studies, Guy Larkin Robbins studies, a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms versus placebo was seen at day 15 following a 14-day treatment course.
The Zuve was also studied as adjunctive therapy as well as monotherapy in these clinical studies, allowing flexible dosing or therapeutic intervention by both providers and for patients.
It's a novel mechanism in class.
Suzuve is a neuroactive steroid gaAA receptor positive modulator with a mechanism of action thought to be related to its positive allosteric modulation of gaba A receptors.
And this fits very nicely with our corporate development growth strategy of developing and acquiring innovative differentiated assets.
Please note the safety information below where the duvet may decrease awareness and alertness.
Which can affect a person's ability to drive safely.
The most common adverse reactions and incidence greater than equal to 5% and greater than placebo, are somblins, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. And please see prescribing information for box warnings and any additional safety information.
On slide 7, talk a little bit about the epidemiology. Postpartum depression or PPD poses a substantial burden to patients and their families.
It's estimated that about 1 in 8 women with a recent live birth experiences symptoms of PPD for approximately 500,000 women per year.
At the right top of the slide you see that of those 500,000, only 40% are diagnosed.
And of those 40% that are diagnosed, only 60% are treated.
Both Sage and Biogen has spent a lot of time and effort increasing the awareness and the diagnosis rates as well as the treatment rates, and we'll continue to work with Biogen to increase all three aspects of this particular therapeutic area.
DPD symptoms are one of the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth.
Perinatal depression is inconsistently diagnosed, as mentioned before, and may be an undertreated condition.
Mothers in perinatal depression mothers with perinatal depression often face significant challenges with functioning and infant bonding.
There's a significant economic burden associated with perinatal depression.
And it's vast vastly impacts patients, their families, employers, and healthcare payers.
In the next slide slide 8, talk a little bit about the successful launch of the survey.
One of our key goals is to capitalize on the foundation for the fantastic launch that was initiated by Sage and Biogen.
The top left hand side of the slide, you see your histograms representing 50% of collaboration revenue reported by Biogen.
If you look at Q1 2024, compared to Q1 2025, you see 123% year over year growth.
From Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, you see a 21% quarter over quarter growth. So fantastic initial launch and continued growth.
The bottom left, we very clearly mentioned a couple of times that we have a collaboration in the US with Biogen.
The Purnas will receive 50% of the US net revenues reported by Biogen.
And sour and Biogen will share certain US operating expenses.
In addition to the US partnership, there's ex-S collaborations as well, both with Biogen and Shinogi. Shinogi has submitted an NDA in Japan for major depressive disorder back in September 2024.
Biogen has also submitted several filings in the EU, UK, and Canada.
So Furnas is eligible to see milestones and royalties on partner XS net sales.
The right hand side here we talk about the successful launch foundation.
Is the first and only branded oral treatment for PPD becoming established as a first choice treatment post delivery.
Their strong awareness is a survey among OBGYN and psychiatrists, apply approximately 90% brand awareness.
PPD diagnosis and treatment rates are growing, and a recent expanded sales force and promotional efforts have increased utilization of revenue in 2025.
There's also increasing number of prescribers with a 20% increase in riders in Q1 of 2025.
Approximately 95% of lives are covered with a favorable or acceptable path to coverage across commercial Medicaid, with the vast majority covered in PPD with no stepeds or complex prior authorizations.
Patient testimonies have been positive and consistent with the survey clinical profile in postpartum depression.
And what's very nice to see is that the media attention and public interest ex has increased awareness and reduced the stigma of PPD.
Hopefully driving more patients to seek help and get the appropriate therapy.
Last slide for me, Sunis is optimally or slide down here. Sunis is optimally positioned to execute commercially while potentially expanding the opportunity in collaboration with Biogen.
We have a track record of successful commercial execution and product integration.
Will continue to establish their zubve as the first choice for women with PPD.
Also continue to expand postpartum depression awareness, diagnosis and treatment.
We plan to work with Biogen to enhance to enhance commercial reach across all channels, encourage and normalize PPD patient dialogue, and continue to deliver positive patient experiences.
In the right right hand side, you see a Venn diagram that captures the initial promotional efforts and focus predominantly in OBGYNs.
Where approximately 70% of the prescriptions are currently coming from, but there's an opportunity to build awareness, diagnosis and treatment both in psychiatry and primary care as well.
That's the end of my section. I'll turn it over to Jack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian, moving on to slide 10, you will see how this transaction, significantly helps us in building for the long term. With what will become 4 different growth drivers in our portfolio on the left side of the slide you'll see on the Parkinson's area we will have two products growth drivers recovery and onAO. OnAO is the new infusion device for apomorphine that we just launched in April of this year.
On the right side of the slide, you'll see in the psychiatry slash OBGYN space, Zube and Calvary.
And you'll see and note the growth between the different products across the different quarters that we're showing on the slide.
So Zube is a very exciting asset that we will be adding to our portfolio. It will represent a new growth opportunity for us into the future and of course, diversify our revenue growth and the cash flows.
Moving on to the next slide.
Slide 11 shows you the overall picture of the transaction. First with the commercial portfolio now will be consisting of 9 marketed products including Zerzove, and also at the bottom of the slide, it will show you the combined expanded pipeline providing supporters also with opportunities for future growth through the potential partners in the collaboration here bygen.
As Brian mentioned, through their marketing efforts in Europe, potentially Canada and other markets, and Shinogi potentially in Japan.
We will also be evaluating the pre-clinical pipeline that Sage has, as we proceed to determine from a portfolio optimization perspective, the different areas that could present themselves as potential investments in further R&D projects.
In summary, this transaction positions us for significant long-term growth. It really adds another major growth drivers. So we are now will have 4 growth drivers that drive our future performance and allow us to continue to build a leading position in CNS. We are very excited also, as I mentioned, about the pipeline, the innovation in the pipeline, and what this transaction adds to our expertise on the discovery side to further give us the opportunity to have sustained innovation and growth into the future. With that, I will now turn it over for question and answer.

q-and-a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced.
Please stand by while we compile the can roster.
Now first question coming from the line of Andrew signed with Jeffrey. Your line is now open.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, congrats on the deal. Thanks for taking my question. First question is how exactly are you guys deriving $200 million of cost synergies up to 200 million from Sage? Can you describe a little bit more in detail the precise overlap, you have already for you to be spending based on our calculation 35% to 40% of what Sage was currently spending and is it safe to assume. Much of their later stage R&D programs will be paused, under your supervision.
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, thanks Andrew. .
The synergies are going to be coming across several areas as we look at the, SGNA R&D, of course, as well. So a lot of the synergies will be coming from both areas. Now one important thing to note here the commercial infrastructure of sage and all the efforts behind the zoos are extremely important, obviously, and will be continued investment in the future moving forward.
So most of the synergies will be on the on the GNA side and the R&D.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Roecklein,     [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it and then.
What can you guys do to drive stronger sales and more awareness in the PPD market that stage maybe going to do what areas do you think you can improve on?
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not an issue of improving or anything like that. We believe that Sage and their partner Bijan has done a phenomenal job launching this product, and the momentum behind the product is fairly evident from the first quarter results that were reported by Bain and Sage. This is an effort that we will be talking, discussing with Baijin, of course, after closing with our partners and working with them closely as Sage has done over, the past couple of years or so.
And the product certainly is in its infancy as far as launch. It's only been launched about a year and a half. So clearly the growth potential of this product is huge, given what Brian just mentioned earlier.
500,000 women every year experience symptoms, in PPD. There is nothing really that has been studied well and approved for the treatment of PPD.
So at the end of the day, the way we look at it is Zerzube actually could become the standard of care, has the potential to become the standard of care in PPD.
This is a huge opportunity and as I mentioned earlier, we are building and will continue to build greatly on the on the great success and impeccable launch that Sage and Biogen has done so far, and we'll be working closely with our future partner Biogen on that.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great thank you congrats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
And our next question coming from the line of Stay with T Coen your line is now open.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, good morning and thanks so much for taking your questions. Congrats on the announcement. So first, starting big picture, our best understanding is the vast majority of prescribers are OBy. So maybe talk about initial commercialization plans and where you expect to grow usage is psychiatry a new clinician target, or is it one that you should expect to grow? So that's the first question and then, second is a follow up on the cost synergies. Can you also maybe talk to the timing. Seems like it should happen quickly given your commentary on 26. So just help us understand what kind of OpEx increase we should be expecting in the short term. So look at say this current spend and how quickly your could occur.
Third question is just maybe talk about the biogen relationship. Thanks so much.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, regarding the first question on the split between OBGYNs and psychiatrists and other physicians, about 80% of the prescriptions are coming from OBGYN, so certainly heavily weighted, I wish you would expect that because OBGYNs are at the front and center of this disease. They're the ones who really see these patients, clear.
As you would expect that, and this, as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, will give us a great opportunity here to further expand our presence in OBGYNs with further potential BD transactions and augment our presence in the OBGYN space. As far as growth, clearly the growth is coming from both sides, but again, the majority at this point early in the launch is through the OBGYN space. Now clearly we have a significant presence in psychiatry and certainly there is an area which we will be looking at very closely, as far as potential synergies here with our existing, commercial footprint. But anything, regarding, the commercialization of the zoos, we will be working very closely, with our partner Main in making any specific decisions, on the future of the product.
As far as the cost synergies, again, I can't be very, specific at this point, but as I mentioned earlier, we expect the synergies to be primarily coming from the GNA area and the R&D, rationalization of the R&D efforts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alright, I can't get off mute, and then maybe talk about your relationship with Bud and whether you expect any changes to current kind of, collaboration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, I mean, like every other partner we have, we expect to have a great collaboration and working very closely with them in building what we believe here is a significant product, as I mentioned earlier, a significant product that could become the standard of care in TPD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Participant,     [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
Now next question coming from the lineup.
Annabel's me withtifo. Your line is now open.
Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on this development just following on on.
Stacy's questions about how you plan on leveraging your relationship, your psychiatry infrastructure, given that the majority of prescriptions are.
Sitting at the OBGYN office, do you have any plans to establish any kind of referral networks into your, psychiatry relationships? It seems like that's where the big expansion opportunity could be and just following on that, are there any kind of limitations, that you have in terms of increasing your investment to be able to. Bring these patients or sort of leverage your create a referral network, be able to leverage that psychiatry infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, a natural question, of course. I mean, again, given our presence in psychiatry, that would be an area which you would expect us to look very closely at as far as potentially further leveraging our infrastructure, and provide additional opportunities to grow the brand. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, the initial launch.
Momentum and everything so far has been through OBGYNs as evident by the fact that 80% of the prescriptions are coming by OBGYNs, but that doesn't mean in the future there isn't the potential there to expand further in the psychiatry space, as we continue and we'll expect to continue to Improve awareness, education, and so forth among prescribers, among the physician audience, whether they were in the OBGYN space or in the psychiatry space as the product gains more and more awareness and use in the marketplace.
We expect, the footprint of prescribers to continue to grow in both market segments, the OBGYN space as well as psychiatrists. So certainly we have, great expectations here. We strongly believe in the potential of the product. And we have no limitations that I can think of right now. Certainly we will be working very closely with our partners after the closing our partner Margin in discussing the plans for the future as we continue to launch the product. The product is still in its very early launch mode at this point. And, again, this is a huge opportunity driven by OBGYNs and yes, potentially even further and deeper into the psychiatry space.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified_7,     [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, and if I could just follow on that this obviously takes you into a whole new area as you mentioned into the OBGYN office I mean you are a CNS focused company so when you talk about, using the OBGYN and office as a potential new area of investment, are we talking about moving away from CNS into more. Women's health type of opportunities or am I reading that incorrectly?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you probably recall, previous calls, when we're always asked about business development, I've mentioned this, several times that we are CNS focused. We continue to look for, corporate development opportunities, external growth opportunities, and CNS, whether it's psychiatry or neurology, as well as I've expressed it, several times that we're also very open to get into new areas that where we can be very effective and build a very good presence. And interestingly, this is a product that actually crosses over between psychiatry and OGYN so you couldn't ask for better.
Addition to our portfolio should we decide, to go outside CNS. So we are going into outside CNS but with a CNS products. So this is an incredible opportunity for us here to continue to be focused on CNS as well as open up a whole new platform for ourselves to OBGYN. And certainly with this transaction, we are very committed and will be committed to continue to invest in the OBGYN space and potentially look for other product opportunities that we can augment our presence with. So this is not a signal that we're walking away from anything specific, but rather a signal that we will continue to invest in both CNS and OBGYN.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified_7,     [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.
Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, and as a reminder to ask a question, please press star 11.
Our next question coming from the line of Kristen Clisa with Can Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Miller, Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, this is Rick Miller on for Kristen. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the deal. So to just start out at a high level, what was it about the postpartum depression market and the asset itself that convinced you that now is the right time to invest in PPD?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, as we mentioned earlier, there hasn't been anything over the years, which was mind boggling, that has been developed for women. Who suffered from PPD. This is an area where there is really no true medication that had been studied well or approved by the FDA for the use. So women need something that is clearly well designed, developed, and studied and approved for that specific indication. So that on its own clearly represents something that is very novel in the marketplace. Again, that could become the standard. Of care in the space currently or before the zoe, I should say, people were using antidepressants, SSRIs, a lot of products that may or may not be actually adequate or even suitable, for postpartum depression.
So that's clearly differentiates the zoe in the marketplace and also. As evident by the results so far, as I mentioned earlier, the excellent launch by Sage and Bayn and the response that the companies have been, receiving from early adopters, women who have used the product. Everything has been very consistent with the clinical profile of the product. A lot of the writers, most of the writers are repeat writers. That also tells you something clearly. And actually about 70%, if I'm not mistaken, of the prescriptions are for women, it's the first treatment for postpartum depression.
It's not even a second line treatment. It's a first line treatment. Again, that's why I keep saying this could potentially become a standard of care. For TPD. So all these collectively, has convinced us that this is a product with significant growth potential, and really can be a dynamite addition for our portfolio for the future growth.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Roecklein,     [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of the country.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Miller, Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. And one more question from us you mentioned that most patients aren't requiring complex prior op, so can you help us understand what the process currently looks like and how rapidly patients are moving from this symptom state to diagnosis to eventually getting on the survey?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, as Brian mentioned earlier, about 90 95% coverage, in the commercial Medicaid space, which is mainly how the pay split is, which is truly incredible for, a product, in the space, especially in the overall depression space, but that again speaks to the uniqueness of the product, the differentiation of the product itself versus generic medications that people have been using historically, and, actually on an average, it's about 3 days, maybe 1 week that it takes from the time a prescription is issued until a product is shipped, to the patient. Again, that is actually, very good turnaround from the time a prescription is issued to the time a product is shipped. So that speaks to the process, of course, of processing. Whether there is a PA or specifically there are no that edits in a lot of the cases, the patient is really getting the product fairly quickly. So overall, very good situation and seems to be, actually helping with patients getting the product as soon as possible. That's, that, that's a very good turnaround. From the time a prescription is issued until the time the patient is getting the shipment, that is really pretty good timing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Vozzo, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - Investor Relations    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
And I see there are no further questions in the Q&AQ at this time, I would now like to send a conference call back over to Mr. Jagaar for any closing remarks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jack Khattar, Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.
In summary, today's announcement represents a major step for us in accelerating its mid to long term growth in revenues and cash flow and in further diversifying our revenue base with a very unique and highly differentiated product as reserved. The transaction strengthens our product portfolio with a 4th growth driver. And has the potential of becoming the standard of care with deserve addition to our portfolio. Thanks for joining us on the call. We look forward to updating you on our next call.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator,     [27]
