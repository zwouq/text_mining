--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth A. Berlin,  Advaxis, Inc. - President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Tim. We're very excited to be here this morning in the U.S. and this afternoon for Roni and others in Israel to announce the proposed merger between Advaxis and Ayala Pharmaceuticals.
On our call today, we will explain why we are so excited about this transaction, and we'll review the terms of the agreement and strategic rationale and then address any questions you may have.  
Joining me on the call today is Ayala's President and CEO, Dr. Roni Mamluk. Our management team and Board have reviewed a number of business development opportunities to determine how best to advance Advaxis to a later stage company. And we believe this transaction with Ayala enables us to meet this goal in a meaningful way. 
This proposed merger will create what we believe will be a stronger oncology company with interesting programs, a global presence and provides the combined company the ability to invest additional cash in a later-stage asset. We also believe that the combined company will be better positioned to uplist to NASDAQ.
Let me summarize the key points and rationale for the transaction. We believe the merger has the potential to transform Advaxis' pipeline. With Ayala, we are gaining a late-stage asset, AL102, which is in a Phase III trial for desmoid tumors. This candidate has a validated mechanism of action and has generated very promising interim data from the ongoing study. We believe it has been significantly derisked and is on a path to potential registration. Ayala has also a second product candidate, AL101, which is being investigated for the treatment of recurrent metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma. 
The combined company will enable the investment of additional cash in a later-stage asset with an estimated $20 million available at closing and an enhanced potential to raise additional cash as needed. 
And finally, we will have an exceptional combined team by adding a very capable and experienced group of professionals in Rehovot, Israel to our associates in New Jersey.  
The addition of Ayala's late-stage assets presents us with the opportunity to reprioritize the combined pipeline of the company.  
Regarding the existing Advaxis pipeline, ADXS-504, our vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer, will continue in a Phase I open-label dose escalation trial at Columbia University toward an anticipated data readout of initial clinical and PSA data in 2023. The cost of this study are predominantly paid for by Columbia.  
Based on our evaluation of the best opportunities in our enhanced portfolio, the company has decided to conduct an orderly wind down of the ADXS-503 program in non-small cell lung cancer in order to focus on AL102 and our other programs.  
The terms of the merger are explained in detail in the press release we issued this morning. This deal has been structured as a reverse merger by our stock-for-stock transaction, where Advaxis will be the technical acquirer. Ayala is incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware, but its principal operations and the majority of its team are in Israel.  
The Board of Directors at closing of this deal consists of 7 individuals: 2 current Advaxis Board members, who will be designated to join the Board; and 4 current Ayala Board members, and I will also become a Board member. I will remain President and CEO. Roni, Founder and CEO of Ayala; and Yossi Maimon, CFO, will be stepping down from their positions. Dr. Andres Gutierrez will be Chief Medical Officer of the combined company. Dr. Gary Gordon, Ayala's current CMO, will resign the closing, but is expected to continue in an advisory role going forward. 
We will provide more details on our plans for the management team in the coming weeks. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, subject to approval by Ayala's shareholders and customary closing conditions.  
To summarize, we are incredibly enthusiastic about what we view as a truly transformational deal. The merger of the 2 companies will create a company with new leadership focused primarily on a substantially derisked asset, AL102, with near-term commercial potential.  
I will now turn the call over to Roni for some additional comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roni Mamluk,  Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Ken. We founded Ayala in 2017 with the mission to develop targeted therapy for people with rare tumors and aggressive cancers. I'm very proud of the progress we have made towards this goal. AL102, our lead product candidate, is now in a potential registration trial. And as Ken mentioned, it has generated very promising interim data. If approved, we believe it will be a valuable new treatment option for patients with desmoid tumors.
Entering into this merger with Advaxis will provide us with the financial resources to advance testing of AL102 for the treatment of desmoid tumors in our pivotal Phase II/III RINGSIDE trial. It will also give us an enhanced presence in the U.S. where we see large opportunity to help these patients.
Today, there are no FDA-approved therapies for desmoid tumors. The annual incidence is approximately 1,700 patients in the United States, and we estimate that there are between 5,500 to 7,000 patients actively seeking treatment in the U.S. at any one time. Note that this is a disease of young people with a 5-year survival rate in excess of 95%. Yet, desmoid tumors can lead to chronic pain, functional deficiencies, [disfiguration] and psychological problems, which have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of patients.
Positive interim data from the open-label Part A of RINGSIDE were featured in an oral presentation at the ESMO Congress in September of this year. The data showed that AL102 monotherapy had a very intriguing therapeutic index with a tolerable safety profile and a meaningful antitumor activity in the majority of patients that appeared to be deepening over time. We look forward to sharing longer-term data from Part A in 2023. 
Part A offering side is the Phase II part of the study, which was conducted primarily to choose a dose for the randomized portion of the study. At this point, a dose of 1.2 milligram once daily has been selected and RINGSIDE Part B, the randomized Phase III portion of the study, is now open for enrollment. In addition, those patients who participated in Part A are eligible to enroll into an open-label extension study with treatment of AL102 at the selected 1.2 milligram once daily dose. 
Earlier this month, Ayala hosted a KOL event webinar to review the RINGSIDE data with industry experts. I encourage you to listen to the replay of this webcast, which can be found on our website to gain a better appreciation of the promise of these assets. Altogether, the early data were considered encouraging by KOL.
At the end of the day, it will be the aggregate data, not only response rate or the progression-free survival, which will define the place of these new drugs in the treatment of desmoid tumors. Our second product candidate, AL101, is being investigated for the treatment of recurrent metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma. We plan to clarify the registration path for this candidate in 2023.
I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues at Ayala who have worked hard over the last 5 years to get us to this advanced stage. I'm pleased to say that we will be keeping our operations in Rehovot, Israel, where the majority of our team is based.
I will now turn the call back to Ken. Ken?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth A. Berlin,  Advaxis, Inc. - President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Roni, for your comments and also for all of your hard work building the excellent team in Rehovot, developing these programs and entrusting this team with them. I know that you share our enthusiasm for the post-merger of our 2 companies.
Our Advaxis leadership team has taken the time to carefully determine how best to transition Advaxis into the next stage of growth and development. We strongly believe that we have made the best selection by combining Ayala's late-stage and derisked drug programs with our U.S. leadership experience, presence and capital. The high therapeutic index of this new drug class has the potential to make a difference in the lives of many patients with desmoid tumors, adenoid cystic carcinoma and other cancers, which fits perfectly with our mission at Advaxis to improve the lives of people living with cancer and their loved ones. 
We're now ready to take questions. Operator?


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Maury Raycroft with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maurice Thomas Raycroft,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on the update. Wondering if you could talk more about how you're thinking about cash runway going forward? And given how long SpringWorks DeFi Phase III took to enroll. can you talk about how the runway will get you to key future milestones?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth A. Berlin,  Advaxis, Inc. - President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maury, it's nice to meet you. I look forward to having engaging dialogues with you in the future. It's a good question. So obviously, cash is a critical component. And while we bring some cash to the table, it's not a complete solution to what we need for the combined company, but it's enough cash to get us certainly through some key milestones in 2023. And we have a way to modulate the spend as needed if the markets just aren't permissive, right? We know these are tough markets certainly for biotech companies. Some are successfully raising money, but companies kind of where we're at, less so. But I do believe there will be opportunities to put more cash on the balance sheet at appropriate time, notwithstanding where the market stands today, but [never say never]. We understand these are tough markets, and we're not going into this with our eyes closed. 
But we believe, again, to come back to the answer to your question, we can modulate spend, if needed. But we think we'll be able to hit key time lines, key milestones this year and also not unduly delay getting to the finish line on the Phase III aspect of the 102 program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maurice Thomas Raycroft,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. That's helpful. And for the ongoing study, as you're enrolling Part B, I guess, could you report some additional data from Part A, potentially PK data or PRO data for Part A or from the open-label extension as you continue with this study?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roni Mamluk,  Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. So actually, if I may take this question. So as you know, Maury, Part A is ongoing and not only that, indeed, we plan to share during 2023 more data from the Part A and more mature data. now this Part B is open and also the open-label extension, and we have selected the dose going forward of 1.2 milligram once a day. We will have patients from Part A switching into the open-label extension. So currently, we expect to have more mature data from those patients that enrolled into Part A. And we expect to be able to report that probably around midyear 2023.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maurice Thomas Raycroft,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And last question for me, just anything else you're saying about enrollment projections for the study at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roni Mamluk,  Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. So this is really too early to tell. We really have only opened the study recently in September. So too early to tell currently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question is from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dane Vincent Leone,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - MD & Biotechnology Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe you could just provide some decision-making rationale or the process that the Boards went through in coming to this merger agreement. And the genesis of this is, obviously, we know nirogacestat works in desmoid tumors as a result of the DeFi study. AL102 is obviously multiple years behind that in a pivotal setting. Is there a data update in '23 for RINGSIDE that more completes the target profile picture of AL102 that would allow a partnership with a larger biopharma company that could shoulder some of the development costs, or what have you had in terms of conversations with potential partners and maybe why hasn't one materialized?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roni Mamluk,  Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken, do you want me to start?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth A. Berlin,  Advaxis, Inc. - President & CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think you'll start, and I'll supplement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roni Mamluk,  Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - President, CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Yes. So I'll start from the end, Dane. So the rationale actually -- or in general, for the rationale for this merger for Ayala, this is, I think, very clear. We were -- Ayala was looking to continue and fund our advanced programs and also, at the same time, to enhance U.S. presence. So Advaxis, we (inaudible) actually allows us to fulfill these 2 requirements. So that's actually the rationale that we went through.
With regard to additional data, I think the longer-term data of patients on AL102 will be very important to understand how AL102 is potentially will be measured against nirogacestat.
First of all, I just wanted to remind everyone that AL102 is given once a day, wherein nirogacestat is given twice a day, which is a benefit if you think about a chronic treatment like gamma secretase inhibitor seems to be for desmoid tumors. In addition, what we have seen in the early data that we saw in Part A is that not only the majority of the patients had tumor volume -- size reduction, this response were deepening over time. 
At ESMO, we had relatively short-term data. So we just started to see the trend of all the parameters. By the way, all the trends were going down on all parameters with this, tumor volume, T1 and T2. So actually, we believe that the longer-term data will enable us now to see treatment over probably a period of 1 year from these patients. And therefore, we will be able to see better how the responses mature and deepening over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth A. Berlin,  Advaxis, Inc. - President & CEO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Dane, from our perspective, I think you insinuated a few things about being behind, being smaller than SpringWorks. Now I'll tell you what we see. And again, it's early days, but we see the potential to have a competitive advantage, certainly dosing advantage. There could be others that need to be borne out with more mature data from the Part A patients and obviously the data from the Part B patients. But we think that there'll be a place -- a decent place for this compound in this market, a small market, but we still think it's a commercially interesting market. So that's what we see and that's what we saw, and that's what ultimately got us here.

Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) I'm not showing any phone questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for further remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kenneth A. Berlin,  Advaxis, Inc. - President & CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, thank you for joining us today. As you can tell, we are excited about the coming together of these 2 companies, obviously, subject to closing Advaxis. As we said, this brings a late-stage asset that we've been looking for, for a while to the fold, and we have cash to put against it. And that's what, obviously, Ayala has seen, an enhanced U.S. presence. So we will provide more updates as things move forward. 
Thank you for participating, and we look forward to talking more in the future.
