Dror Harats,  Vascular Biogenics Ltd. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, and thanks for joining us for this exciting announcement for VBL shareholders. I'd now like to provide a brief overview of the transaction on Slide 4, and then I will turn the call over to Dr. Thomas Bock for the presentation of Notable Labs business. Back in August of 2022, we announced our intent to pursue strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. We felt and with substantial justification that the market value of our company was significantly less than its true worth and embarked on process to unlock this overlooked value. 
Our first case strategic transaction under this process was the recently announced sale of our facility and associated assets for $7.1 million. Second, and that's the reason for our presentation today, after a thorough and extensive review of our options the Board of both VBL Therapeutics and Notable Labs have agreed that the 2 companies would merge to create a leading clinical-stage oncology company utilizing Notable's predictive precision medicine platform to develop therapeutic in more efficient and effective way for the benefit of patients in need.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of Notable Lab will receive newly issued shares of VBL common stock. Notable Lab shareholders are expected to own approximately 76% of the combined company after accounting for the premerger financing and VBL stockholders will own approximately 24% of the combined company. The percentage of the combined company that VBL stockholders will own as of the close of the transaction is subject to adjustment based on the amount of Notable's net proceeds from the financing and VBL's net cash at the closing date among other adjustments as described in the merger agreement.
The transaction is being supported by $10.3 million financing led by recognized healthtech investors, including Builders VC, B Capital Group, Y Combinators, First Round Capital and Founders Fund. The combined company is expected to operate under the name Notable Labs with its share listed on the NASDAQ capital market under the ticker symbol NTBL. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.
I've been in drug development for over 30 years and believe that Notable is going to be able to crack some of the holy grails in drug development, most notably, the ability to predict patient response to a given treatment before embarking on it. Many have tried, but what makes Notable unique is there a combination of cutting-edge biology and data analysis using machine learning against their proprietary database of over 190 billion lines of data derived from analysis of patient's tissues, blood samples and clinical outcome. 
With this from the national platform rather than primarily use it as a diagnostic as a standard they are taking a unique approach, utilizing it to build a portfolio, a new type of precision medicine, predictive precision medicine. Notable, in licensed asset has already demonstrated compelling clinical activity have been validated on the platform prior to acquisition and then develop them with a promise of being able to select clinically responding patients and thus achieve high prospective response rate. This would save significant time and money during clinical development and position the program for commercial success with longer patent protection.
We have also had the chance to work closely with their excellent management team who have great track record developing blockbuster drugs and are supported by strong top-tier syndicate of investors who we believe will continue to support the company's growth in the public market.
In coming to where we are today, after thorough and excessive search, we confidently believe that the proposed merger company not only provide the best path forward, but also delivers compelling synergism and economism that will position the new enterprise to deliver both near-term and long-term value for existing VBL and Notable Labs stockholders and patients.
I'd like to turn the call over to Thomas now to provide an overview of Notable Labs. As many of you know, Dr. Bock has led the development and commercialization of numerous cancer and rare disease treatments, including paradigm-changing blockbusters, such as Gleevec, Revlimid and Solaris. Thomas has led the transition of Notable Labs from a diagnostic focused to an integrated therapeutic platform company. He is now poised to move the company further ahead. Thomas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas A. Bock,  Notable Labs, Inc. - CEO & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Thank you very much, Dror. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am excited to be here today and to introduce you to Notable Labs. Before advancing through the balance of the presentation, I'd first like to acknowledge and thank Dror; Sam Backenroth, VBL's CFO; and the entire VBL Board and team for their confidence in Notable Labs. I would like to highlight and thank them for their diligence, strategic input and commitment to stockholders along the entire process. And due to not only did both our boards approved and strongly support this deal, but as you mentioned, in addition, Notable Labs has received a remarkable commitment for 10.3 million private replacements by leading healthtech investors and long-term supporters. And I would like to especially highlight and thank Builders VC, B Capital Group, Y Combinators, First Round Capital and Founders Fund for the tremendous support over many years and for the expression of great confidence into our team, plans and growth. 
I would like to thank and applaud Matt De Silva for his vision on perseverance and founding and building Notable as an inspirational and caring company that focuses the most cutting-edge technology on transforming the lives of patients in desperate need.
Turning to Slide 5. Notable is defining a new field of precision medicine, predictive precision medicine, and we are emerging biology and technology to achieve a highly ambitious goal to dramatically improve patient outcomes and the success, speed and return on investment on drug development. 
We believe that patients urgently need approaches that go beyond the traditional precision medicine paradigm, beyond targeting genetic mutations. There is no doubt that traditional precision medicines have created huge advances, and I personally have a great purpose of being part of the development and commercialization of the world's first cancer precision medicine, imatinib, also known as Gleevec, a drug targeting a genetic mutation that is driving chronic myeloid leukemia. As a physician, I am thrilled about the life-changing impact this precision medicine has made for patients worldwide. But in the big picture, less than 15% of cancer patients carry a known and action of biomarker and precision medicines can therefore only be defined for less than 15% of patients. 
The others are left behind and only few precision medicines are as successful as Gleevec in many clinical settings, traditional precision medicines deliver a response rate of only 30% or less. This is because so many other factors other than genetic mutations are impacting whether a patient actually responds even to a perfectly designed precision medicine. A great example is well-known precision medicine gilteritinib, which is targeting FLT3, a genetic mutation found in acute myeloid leukemia. It is a well-defined FLT3 targeting drug and yet only 34% of gilteritinib-treated FLT3 patients respond.
Notable believe that it is the precision the accuracy of predicting an individual patient's clinical response that is the foundation of dramatically improving patient outcomes and derisking the development of new treatments. This is the reason why Notable has created a unique predictive precision medicine platform, PPMP, to accurately predict the patients who are most likely to respond to a treatment and importantly, without the need of genetic markers. Notable's PPMP combines their power of biology with the power of technology, including engineering, digital technology and computational data science.
Instead of focusing on 1 genetic pathway or 1 other feature, PPMP measures the ex vivo biological response of cancer and normal cells to drug across many signals and many dimensions. Hundreds of thousands of data points per patient sample are then integrated and translated by computational algorithms into a patient response predictor, that describes whether the patient is going to respond to their actual treatment.
Again, we believe that it is the precision, the accuracy, the quality of predicting response that drives the magnitude of improving patient outcome and the success of drug development. Therefore, Notable's PPMP has been designed as a high-throughput automated platform that enables virtual learning cycles and continuous optimization patient sample by patient sample. Our continuous learning and optimization made possible that all of Notable's clinical validation studies with recognized medical centers at Stanford University and MD Anderson Cancer Center, all these studies predicted responding patients with a high level of predictive precision as my colleague and Notable's Chief Scientific Officer, Joe Wagner, will share with you in a moment.
Already today, our continuously growing data repository is massive and includes over 190 billion lines of data derived from the analysis of patient tissue, blood samples and clinical outcomes and counting. This data repository is notable digital backbone and drive our strategy of expanding our platform capabilities from disease to disease and more and more predicted medical outcomes. 
While we are working with top academic centers to continually advance and expand our platform, we focus our business model and resources on developing and delivering a new type of precision medicine, predictive precision medicine. This is how we do it. We focus on indications with high unmet needs because that is where the greatest value for patients and shareholders can be created. Typically, that would be clinical settings in which only 1 in 3 treated patients respond to currently available treatment or patients for whom available treatments do not work at all. 
Using PPMP, we target an in-license assets with demonstrated compelling clinical activity, but only in 10% to 30% of treated patients. In the hands of other companies, many of these assets either have concerned by the FDA approvability or their commercial success due to their low response rate. But we at Notable have screened hundreds of assets on our platform and for many of these assets, we can predict their clinically responding patients with high precision. This provides us with the opportunity to fast track their development selectively in clinical responders and to deliver a higher response rate.
Assuming that Notable predictive precision medicines delivered the high response rates that correspond to the high predictive position that we showed in our clinical validation study, our business model can be expected to deliver superior competitive profiles in our targeted settings. 
As Joe will share in more detail, Notable has in-licensed Volasertib, a drug that was originally developed through Phase III by Boehringer Ingelheim and that has shown clinical activity across liquid and solid tumors. Notable's lead program is geared to serve patients with acute myeloid leukemia with Phase IIa clinical results planned for the third quarter of 2024. We are also codeveloping Fosciclopirox together with its sponsor CicloMed. After an early collaboration with CicloMed demonstrated a strong performance of Fosciclopirox on our predictive platform. Top line results from Fosciclopirox Phase IIa trial are expected in the fourth quarter of this year.
For patients and physicians, the use of our platform is simple, blood or bone marrow sample containing cancer cells and normal cells are shipped to Notable Labs and is co-processed with a given drug or drugs under our optimized proprietary conditions. Our PPMP measures the differential behavior and response of the patient's cancer cells versus normal cells down to the single cell level and our algorithm translate those hundreds of thousands of data points into a patient response predictor. The patients predicted response is delivered within days from sample received and test within the clinically actionable time frame. How many predictive responders will respond to the actual treatment is called the precision of such a platform.
Predictive precision does translate into clinical response rates. And in the 3 clinical validation studies that Joe will share, all patients identified by PPMP responders, except one, it respond to the actual treatment. This level of precision has been achieved by merging biology and technology with the goal of overcoming the limitations of traditional precision medicines and the more recent approaches of AI-driven drug design. PPMP replaces 1 dimensional targeting with multidimensional response measuring and simply puts biology back into computational model to reflect more closely, what's actually going on in the patient treatment.
PPMP enables a superior differentiation of Notable's business model. One, Using PPMP Notable can target and in-license the most compelling assets with demonstrated clinical activity; two, Fast Track remaining development selectively in responding patients with smaller and less costly trials; and three, deliver a superior competitive profile by enriching responding patients during development. 
Leveraging PPMP this is our vision for tomorrow's medicines. Nothing less than improving the medical outcomes for patients dramatically while at the same time, simplifying the practice of medicine for physicians in a more and more complex world, where today, patients and physicians often face tough choices between multiple treatments with unpredictive outcomes guided by complex guidelines. Notable aspires that tomorrow, they would jointly achieve predictable and compelling outcomes, simply using a test that ensures that each treated patient is a responding patient.
Slide 12 summarizes the targeted direct impact of successfully predicting responding patients, improved patient outcomes and derisk drug development and that's due to the enriching of responding patients. This enables smaller trials, faster trials and less costly trials. Importantly, combining a predictive medicine with PPMP as its companion diagnostics, creates the potential for a new IP and thus longer patent protection for marketed treatments. The prospect of substantial and scalable value creation with fewer resources compared to traditional drug development.
We outlined our lead development program here on Slide 13. Notable's in-licensed asset is Volasertib, which is a highly potent PLK1 inhibitor, proving to reduce cell cycle arrest and atoposis and various cancer cells. While Volasertib demonstrated meaningful clinical responses in the subset of study patients in both the Phase II and the Phase III trial in our upcoming and redefined Phase IIa trial, we will leverage PPMP to identify Volasertib response to patients prior to treatment and selectively enroll PPMP predicted clinical responders. We expect to initiate our Phase II study in adult AML in the third quarter of 2023, with top line results expected in the third quarter of 2024.
Fosciclopirox, our other partner program is a product of ciclopirox and was invented by scientists at the University of Kansas Cancer Center and the Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation, University of Kansas Medical Center product development enterprise. Notable and CicloMed sponsor of ciclopirox have initiated a co-development Phase IIa clinical trial of Fosciclopirox in adult patients with AML. We are applying our PPMP platform to assess patient sensitivity to Fosciclopirox and expect this study to read out in the fourth quarter of 2023.
I'd now like to turn the presentation over to my colleague, Joe Wagner, to discuss the intricacies of the PPMP platform and the data that our team has produced. Joe?

Joseph P. Wagner,  Notable Labs, Inc. - Chief Scientific Officer    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Thomas. Let's begin on Slide 14 with an overview of our predictive precision medicine platform represented schematically on this slide. Here, we depict the inputs to the platform on the left the customized biological experiments that are conducted in the middle and the output on the right. Starting on the left to determine whether a patient is likely to respond to a given treatment, we take a fresh sample of the patient's tumor cells and incubate them with the drug we are testing. Then using our customized high-throughput assays, we measure the biological response of the cells to the drug. We collect hundreds of thousands of data points at the individual cellular level from each patient.
Unlike past precision medicine approaches, which essentially only counted total dead cells, we customize the assay by optimizing pharmacokinetics, parameters such as dose and dosing schedule and pharmacodynamics, biological endpoints, the specific mechanism of action for a particular drug class. For example, some drug classes work by directly killing tumor cells, for example, classic chemotherapeutics, while other drugs exert more cell effects on cells or even act indirectly through other cell populations, for example, immuno-oncology drugs. The features that we measure include proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle arrest and cell that, among others.
As you might imagine, the optimization of our assays and training of our algorithms requires large-scale experiments and hyper-complex experimental designs. In order to maximize experimental throughput on our platform, we have integrated hardware, automation and customized software into a work cell-based platform in order to design, execute and analyze our results. This predictive precision medicine platform represents the discovery and development engine at Notable Labs.
We turn now to one of our central differentiators and barriers to entry. To keep developing the highest performing predictive assays like in having access to large quantities of patient data. This reflects the general truth of data science, the bigger the data set, the higher the predictive power of any data set derived algorithm. To date, we have analyzed patient responsiveness ex vivo across thousands of primary samples, creating a significant functional drug sensitivity data set. 
So far, we have been broadly focused in hematologic malignancies, but have had some success with a variety of solid tumors. The repository currently consists of 190 billion lines of data, and we continue to receive samples from up to 10% of a given days AML patients in the U.S. This access reflects our strong relationships with top-tier medical institutions across the country and gives us an extraordinary database to power our predictive algorithms.
Finally, it constitutes a barrier to entry that other companies in the sector cannot easily surmount. The data we generate from these retrospective or Avatar trials can then be clinically validated in prospective validation studies.
I would like now to review with you the study designs from our clinical validation studies. To date, we have conducted 4 validation trials and collaborations with leaders in the field of hematology, at top-tier university hospitals. I won't get into the very specific details of the individual studies, which are summarized in this slide, other than to say that these studies assess our platform performance across several different blood cancers and multiple standard of care treatment options. All of the studies share a similar design. First, patients are enrolled into the study immediately prior to receiving a treatment. Second, a baseline sample of peripheral blood or bone marrow is obtained and patient responses are assessed ex vivo and the notable platform. Finally, patients that receive treatment and the outcome of that treatment response or no response is then compared to the predicted outcome as obtained from the platform.
Let's turn to the results of the first 3 trials, which appear on this slide. The data I presented is so-called (inaudible), in brief, each dot represents an individual patient. On the Y-axis, patients with notable scores below 0 are flagged as responders on the platform. On the x-axis, we have the actual clinical outcomes that is nonresponders versus responders. Blue dot signified patients that demonstrated clinical outcomes consistent with our prediction, orange dots represent incorrect outcome predictions from the platform. The critical area to look at on these plots is the lower right region. That is patients that we predicted would respond to the treatment and actually did demonstrate the response clinically. 
The predictive precision or what is formerly known as positive predictive value is a proportion of patients predicted to respond who actually respond. It is calculated by taking the total number of patients who both responded and were predicted to respond total number of patients on the lower right and dividing this number by the total number of patients predicted to respond. That is total number of patients in the bottom half of the diagram with a negative notable score. We observed that predictive precision ranged from a low of 83% in the MD Anderson study to 100% in the Stanford and Texas Children's studies. 
Here's the way to think of this. If we had limited the patients we treated in these studies to people who have been predicted to be responders by the notable platform, the response rate observed in the clinic would range from 83% to 100%. We did not include the results of the Washington University study, but results from this trial are in and will be presented at the AACR meeting this spring in San Diego.
Now we know that these results sound astonishing, and we believe that they are indeed very strong. However, we recognize that these are relatively small studies. Collectively, they have enrolled a total of 74 patients. But we examined them rigorously using accepted statistical methods, including boot strapping for small sample size to determine what range of performance we might see in a large patient population.
Let us look at the confidence intervals that emerge from these analyses. Using the most conservative estimate, the lower bound of the confidence intervals, we accurately predict responders with 69% accuracy in the Stanford study, 50% in the MD Anderson study and 100% of the Texas Children's study. Now just to remind you, gilteritinib is an approved drug, which targets FLT3, a genetic mutation found a 30% of patients with AML, still only 34% gilteritinib-treated FLT3-positive patients respond. As Thomas noted, we plan to target indications where the standard of care provides a response rate of less than 30%. The most conservative estimate for the accuracy of our predictions is 50%. This estimate suggests the response of patients to drugs identified by our platform will exceed those of an approved therapeutic and our target indications by at least 20%.
After we demonstrated the robust performance of our predictive platform in these validation studies focused on the current standard of care agents, Notable began a search for therapeutic assets to in-license and derisk using our platform. We focused our search and available therapeutics and hematology space. Three key criteria guided our search. First, the asset had to have significant patient experience, that means a Phase II study or later so that pharmacokinetic safety profile, et cetera, would already be defined. Second, in hedge had demonstrated responders and activity in clinical trials. Third, there had to be a significant market opportunity with a large unmet medical need in 1 or more indications for which it had been trialed. Our search identified over 80 potential candidates. We then began procuring these candidates under MTA and tested them on our platform to identify the highest performance.
Here, our criteria for success was high performance on the platform. I'll describe what high performance means on the next slide. Suffice it to say, the first candidate assets across the finish line was Volasertib. A little about Volasertib. Volasertib is a novel PLK1 inhibitor originally developed by Boehringer Ingelheim. Boehringer Ingelheim advanced Volasertib in a number of clinical trials with the main focus on AML, which they brought through Phase III trials. The results of the Phase II and Phase III trials have been published and are available to the public. 
In a nutshell, they observed a 31% overall response rate in their Phase II, which translated into significant improvements in overall survival. While Phase III demonstrated a 27% overall response rate that did not translate into significant improvement in survival, which led the (inaudible) asset. Most importantly, Volasertib meets the pipeline criteria in terms of efficacy signal and extensive patient experience. What about performance on our platform? To assess this, we conducted an Avatar trial in a prospective patient cohort.
This slide summarizes the results of our Volasertib Avatar trial. In this study, we collected patient samples from 65 AML patients and ran the samples through our screening platform using a locked assay optimized to stratify predictive responders. Our analysis predicted that 20 of 65 or approximately 30% of patients in this population would respond to treatment with Volasertib. Remember, 30% is equivalent to the response rate that BI found in their Phase II study in AML, consistent with our hypothesis that the platform will identify AML patients who respond to Volasertib. 
Now Assuming our previous validation study results are an accurate guide. That means if we were to enroll these 20 patients into our clinical trial, we would expect that between 50% and 100% of the participants in this trial will demonstrate clinical response to Volasertib. 
This slide lays out the clinical development path for Volasertib that we will pursue beginning in 2023, a pathway similar for any Phase II ready or later asset that we acquire. In brief, we will initiate a 2-part Phase II in AML focused on locking the algorithm cutoff in Phase IIa and validating the performance of the selection algorithm in Phase IIb. Upon successful Phase II, we will initiate a registrational Phase III. By properly delineating the likely responder populations and focusing the trial on these patients, we estimate that we can reduce the number of patients in the original Phase III trial from 666 to approximately 150. 
We also estimate that the time from Phase IIa trial to FDA approval can be reduced from 90 months to 30 to 40 months and that the patent life after FDA approval can be extended from 7 to 8 years to 20 years. Volasertib's sensitivity assay will be regulated as a companion diagnostic and will appear in the label of Volasertib upon approval. All told, the overall financial risk associated with the trial is significantly reduced increasing the expected return to investors.
An additional benefit of our platform is that by pairing Volasertib with our prediction platform, we generate new defensible patent claims that could significantly extend the exclusivity period of Volasertib and provide an efficacy bar that enhances its commercial potential in a large market like AML.
Now I will turn the microphone back to Thomas. Thomas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 22 translates Notable's development strategy for predictive precision medicines into our anticipated value-inflecting milestones including Phase IIa top line results from the co-development of Fosciclopirox in the fourth quarter of 2023. Phase IIa top line results of Volasertib in the third quarter of 2 and Volasertib Phase IIb top line results in the first quarter of 2025, all in their lead indication, adult AML. As mentioned earlier, we are excited that the results from Notable's fourth clinical validation study in collaboration with Washington University will be presented at the AACR Annual Meeting in April of this year.
Talking about excitement, leads me directly to our experience and collaborative team on Slide 23, a team that brings together ideas and expertise that typically are not found within 1 single company from therapeutics to diagnostics, engineering and data science. Collectively, our team members have developed and commercialized dozens of diagnostics and therapeutics including multibillion blockbuster medicines and 4 of the 5 most successful launches in hematology and rare diseases. They have built, lead, acquired and/or IPOed more than a dozen companies, which greatly facilitated the momentum of Notable and VBLT coming together.
So together, we now continue to pursue Notable's aspirational and vicious vision, transforming patient outcomes through predictive precision medicine, patient by patient, cancer by cancer. Thank you very much.
